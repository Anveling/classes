<p>This course studies software used in many commercial activities to
related to Big Data. The backdrop for course relates to more than 300
software subsystems illustrated in Figure 1.</p>
<div class="align-center figure" id="id1">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/bigdata.png"><img alt="300 Technologies" src="../_images/bigdata.png" style="width: 200px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text"><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Software Systems relevant for Big Data</span></p>
</div>
<p>We will describe the software architecture represented by this
collection and work towards identifying best practices to deploy,
access and interface with them. Topics of this class will include:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The cloud computing architecture underlying open source big data
software and frameworks and contrast of them to high performance
computing</li>
<li>The software architecture with its different layers covering broad
functionality and rationale for each layer.</li>
<li>We will go through selected big data stack software from the list
of more than 300</li>
<li>We will be identifying how we can create replicate software
environments based on software deployed and used on clouds while
using Containers, OpenStack and ansible playbooks.</li>
<li>Students will chose one other open source member of Kaleidoscope
each and deploy as illustrated in class.</li>
<li>The main activity of the course will be building a significant
project using multiple subsystems combined with user code and
data. Projects will be suggested or students can chose their own. A
project report will summarize the work conducted.</li>
</ol>
<p>Students of this class will need to conduct their project deployments
in python using ansible and enabling a software stack that is useful
for a big data analysis. While it is not necessary to know either
python or ansible to take the class it is important that you have
knowledge of a programming language so you can enhance your knowledge
on them throughout the class and succeed.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">A note to current I523 class participants: While I523 is a
beginners class I524 is an advanced class and we expect that
you know python which you hopefully have learned as part of
I523. If not, make sure you learn it before you take this
class. If not consider significant additional time needed
for that class. You will be expected to have a computer on
which you have python installed.  You will be using
chameleon and possibly our local cloud. Optionally some
projects may use docker. A significant amount of time will
be spend to familiarize yourself with the technologies more
so than in I523.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Residential students enroll early so we avoid the situation
like last year where we had many signing up, but did not
even show up to the first lecture. I have asked that
students from I523 have preference, but I am not sure if we
can enforce this. So enroll ASAP.</p>

<h2>Who can take the class?<a class="headerlink" href="#who-can-take-the-class" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Undergrads can take this class. Make sure you have enough time and
fulfill the prerequisites such as knowing a programming language
well and you have enough time to learn python.</li>
<li>You could take I524 without taking I523, but you must be proficient
in python and catch up with some of the material in I523 which makes
the selection of a project easier.</li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Project groups:</strong> Groups of up to three students can work on a
project but workload increases with each student and a work break
down must be provided.  More than three students are not
allowed. For a team you will be asked to deploy a larger system or
demonstrate deployability on multiple clouds while benchmarking it.</li>
<li><strong>Technology papers:</strong> Technology papers must be non-overlapping in
the entire class. If multiple students select the same technology,
we will be drawing randomly which students does which technology. As
we have over 300 such technologies we should have enough for the
entire class. If you see technologies missing, let us know and we
see how to add them.</li>
<li><strong>Technology paper groups:</strong> Groups of up to three students can work
also on the technology papers. However the workload is not reduced,
you will produce 3 times the number of group members technology
papers of unique technologies. However, you could be having
coauthors that are part of your group. Please do not ask us how many
technology papers you need to write if you are in a group. The rule
is clearly specified. Example: Your group has 3 members, each of
them has to procude 3 unique papers, thus you have to produce 9
unique technology papers for this group. If you have 2 members you
have to produce 6, if you work alone you have to produce 3.</li>
<li><strong>Technology deployment for your project:</strong> Each student will
develop as part of the project a deployment of a technology. Points
may depend on effort and simplicity of the deployment.</li>
<li><strong>No bonus projects:</strong> This class will not have any bonus projects
or regrading requests. Instead you need to focus your time on the
papers and the project assignments.</li>
<li><strong>Voluntary work:</strong> You are welcome to conduct assignments and
excerises you find on the class Web page on your own. However they
are not graded or considered for extra credit.</li>
<li><strong>Chance for publishing a paper:</strong> If however you find that the work
you do could lead to a publishable paper, you could work together
with the course instructor as coauthors to conduct such an
activity. However, this is goind to be a significant effort and you
need to decide if you like to conduct this. In such cases if the
work is sufficient for publication submission, an A+ for the class
could be considered. It will be a lot of work. The length of such a
paper is typically 10-12 high quality pages including figures and
references. We may elect for the final submission to use a different
LaTeX style</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="prerequisites">
<h2>Prerequisites<a class="headerlink" href="#prerequisites" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We expect you are familiar with:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>(easy) Linux or the Operating system on which you will focus your
deployment.</li>
<li>(moderate) Note that Windows as OS will not be sufficient as Ansible
is not supported on it. However you can use virtualbox or log onto
one of the clouds to get access to an OS that supports ansible.</li>
<li>(easy) Python 2.7.x (we will not use python 3 for this class as it
is not yet portable with all systems) (we consider learning python
as easy, however some students found it challenging)</li>
<li>(easy) pip</li>
<li>(easy) virtualenv</li>
<li>(easy) an editor (emacs, vi, jedit, pyCharm, eclipse, or other)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are not familiar with the technologies, we expect that you get
to know them during class. This may pose additional time commitment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="open-source-publication-of-homework">
<h2>Open Source Publication of Homework<a class="headerlink" href="#open-source-publication-of-homework" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As this class is about open source technologies, we will be using the
same to gather and distribute the homework submissions.</p>
<p>The results of all technology papers will be available as a single big
report. Due to the organization as a single report bound into a book
format of the technologies, all reports must be written in LaTeX and
jabref must be used to manage references. This class will therefore
not accept word, openoffice, and endnote. Alternatively lyx.org can be
used, if you prefer to edit latex in <em>what you see is almost what you
get</em> format. The use of sharelatex or overleave is allowed.</p>

<div class="section" id="mistakes">
<span id="index-1"></span><h2>Mistakes<a class="headerlink" href="#mistakes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>While teaching our classes we noticed the following mistakes students
often make:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Overestimating the technical abilities</li>
<li>Underestimating the time it takes to do the project</li>
<li>Unnecessarily struggling with LaTeX as you do not use an example we
provide</li>
<li>Trying to do things on Windows Which is typically more difficult
than using Linux</li>
<li>Having a computer that is underpowered or outdated</li>
<li><strong>Procrastinating</strong></li>
<li><strong>Take other classes more serious</strong></li>
<li><strong>Starting the project not in the first 4 weeks of the class</strong></li>
<li>not listening to the lectures</li>
<li>Ignoring security via ssh</li>
<li>Posting passwords into git</li>
<li>Being not aware that git does <strong>not</strong> allow to easily completely
delete files that contain secret information such as passwords</li>
<li>Assume your colleagues does the work, so you get lazy</li>
<li>Underestimating the <strong>time</strong> it takes to do deployments</li>
<li>Not reading our piazza posts and repeating the same question over
and over</li>
<li>Sending mail to instructors, which will be out of principal deleted
and not read. Instead you should use piazza</li>
<li>Not using Piazza to communicate and instead use CANVAS. We will
be deleting all canvas posts after we have established you can post
to piazza. Which will be the first week of class.</li>

<div class="section" id="software-project">
<h2>Software Project<a class="headerlink" href="#software-project" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In case of a software project, we encourage a group project with up to
three members.  You can use the
<a class="reference external" href="https://piazza.com/class/irqfvh1ctrg2vt">discussion forum in the folder project</a>
to form project teams or just communicate privately with other class
members to formulate a team. The following artifacts are part of the
deliverables for a project</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Code:</dt>
<dd>You must deliver the code in gitlab. The code must be compilable
and a TA may try to replicate to run your code. You MUST avoid
lengthy install descriptions and everything must be installable
from the command line. We will check submission. All team members
must be responsible for one part of the project.</dd>
<dt>Project Report:</dt>
<dd><p class="first">A report must be produced while using the format discussed in the
Report Format section. The following length is required:</p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li>4 pages, one student in the project</li>
<li>6 pages, two students in the project</li>
<li>8 pages, three students in the project</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Work Breakdown:</dt>
<dd><p class="first">This document is only needed for team projects. A one page PDF
document describing who did what. It includes pointers to
the git history that documents the statistics that demonstrate not
only one student has worked on the project.</p>
<p class="last">In addition the graders will go into gitlab, which provides a
history of checkins to verify each team member has used gitlab to
checkin their contributions frequently. E.g. if we find that one
of the students has not checked in code or documentation at all,
it will be questioned.</p>
</dd>
<dt>License:</dt>
<dd>All projects are developed under an open source license such as
Apache 2.0 License, or similar. You will be required to add a
LICENCE.txt file and if you use other software identify how it can be
reused in your project. If your project uses different licenses,
please add in a README.rst file which packages are used and which
license these packages have.</dd>

<h2>Code Repositories Deliverables<a class="headerlink" href="#code-repositories-deliverables" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Code repositories are for code, if you have additional libraries that
are needed you need to develop a script or use a DevOps framework to
install such software. Thus zip files and .class, .o files are not
permissible in the project. Each project must be reproducible with a
simple script. An example is:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">git</span> <span class="n">clone</span> <span class="o">....</span>
<span class="n">make</span> <span class="n">install</span>
<span class="n">make</span> <span class="n">run</span>
<span class="n">make</span> <span class="n">view</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Which would use a simple make file to install, run, and view the
results. Naturally you can use ansible or shell scripts. It is not
permissible to use GUI based DevOps preinstalled
frameworks. Everything must be installable form the command line.</p>
