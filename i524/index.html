<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This course studies software used in many commercial activities
related to Big Data. The backdrop for course containes more than 370
software subsystems illustrated in Figure 2.</p>
<div class="align-center figure" id="id1">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/bigdata.png"><img alt="370 Technologies" src="../_images/bigdata.png" style="width: 200px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text"><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Software Systems relevant for Big Data</span></p>
</div>
<p>We will describe the software architecture represented by this
collection and work towards identifying best practices to deploy,
access and interface with them. Topics of this class will include:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The cloud computing architecture underlying open source big data
software and frameworks and contrast of them to high performance
computing</li>
<li>The software architecture with its different layers covering broad
functionality and rationale for each layer.</li>
<li>We will go through selected big data stack software from the list
of more than 370</li>
<li>We will be identifying how we can create and replicate software
environments based on software deployed and used on clouds while
using Containers, OpenStack and ansible playbooks.</li>
<li>Students will chose a number of open source members of the list
each and create repeatable deployments as illustrated in class.</li>
<li>The main activity of the course will be building a significant
project using multiple subsystems combined with user code and
data. Projects will be suggested or students can chose their own. A
project report will summarize the work conducted.</li>
</ol>
<p>Students of this class will need to conduct their project deployments
in python using ansible and enabling a software stack that is useful
for a big data analysis. While it is not necessary to know either
python or ansible to take the class it is important that you have
knowledge of a programming language so you can enhance your knowledge
on them throughout the class and succeed. You will be expected to have
a computer on which you have python 2.7.x installed.  You will be
using chameleon and possibly our local cloud. Optionally some projects
may use docker.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">You do not have to take I523 in order to take I524.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">For previous I523 class participants: While I523 is a
beginners class I524 is an advanced class and we expect that
you know python which you hopefully have learned as part of
I523 while doing a software project. If not, make sure you
learn it before you take this class or consider
<strong>significant</strong> additional time needed to learn it for the
class.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Residential students need to enroll early so we avoid the
situation like last year where we had many signing up, but
did not even show up to the first lecture. I have asked that
students from I523 have preference, but I am not sure if we
can enforce this. So enroll ASAP. Those that are on the
waiting list are recommended to show up in the first
class. It is likely that you can join as others drop.</p>
</div>
<p>Figure 1 illustrates that you can follow the components of the class
in a variety of ways. Furthermore, you do not have to wait to start
the project of the Web homework till you have listened to all
lectures. Naturally if you do not know how to collaborate via github
you will not be able to submit the homework, so you need to figure
this out first.</p>

<li>Undergrads can take this class. Make sure you have enough time and
fulfill the prerequisites such as knowing a programming language
well and you have enough time to learn python.</li>
<li>You could take I524 without taking I523, but you must be proficient
in python and catch up with some of the material in I523 which makes
the selection of a project easier.</li>

</table>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Project groups:</strong> Groups of up to three students can work on a
project but workload increases with each student and a work break
down must be provided.  More than three students are not
allowed. For a team you will be asked to deploy a larger system or
demonstrate deployability on multiple clouds while benchmarking it.</li>
<li><strong>Technology papers:</strong> Technology papers must be non-overlapping in
the entire class. If multiple students select the same technology,
we will be drawing randomly which students does which technology. As
we have over 370 such technologies we should have enough for the
entire class. If you see technologies missing, let us know and we
see how to add them.</li>
<li><strong>Technology paper groups:</strong> Groups of up to three students can work
also on the technology papers. However the workload is not reduced,
you will produce 3 times the number of group members technology
papers of unique technologies. However, you could be having
coauthors that are part of your group. Please do not ask us how many
technology papers you need to write if you are in a group. The rule
is clearly specified. Example: Your group has 3 members, each of
them has to procude 3 unique papers, thus you have to produce 9
unique technology papers for this group. If you have 2 members you
have to produce 6, if you work alone you have to produce 3.</li>
<li><strong>Technology deployment for your project:</strong> Each student will
develop as part of the project a deployment of a technology. Points
may depend on effort and simplicity of the deployment.</li>
<li><strong>Late homework</strong>: Any late homework will be receiving a 10% grade
reduction.  As this is a large class and the assignments are not
standard multiple choice questions, grading will take a considerable
time. Some homework can not be delivered late as they are related to
establish communication with you. Such <strong>deadline specific</strong>
homework will receive 0 points in case they are late. See course
calendar. It is the student’s responsibility to upload submissions
well ahead of the deadline to avoid last minute problems with
network connectivity, browser crashes, cloud issues, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Frequent checkins</strong>: It is <strong>important</strong> to make frequent and
often commits to the github repository as the activities will be
monitored and will be integrated into the project grade.  Note that
paper and project will take a considerable amount of time and doing
proper time management is a must for this class. Avoid starting your
project late. Procrastination does not pay off.</li>
<li><strong>No bonus projects:</strong> This class will not have any bonus projects
or regrading requests. Instead you need to focus your time on the
papers and the project assignments.</li>
<li><strong>Voluntary work:</strong> You are welcome to conduct assignments and
excerises you find on the class Web page on your own. However they
are not graded or considered for extra credit.</li>
<li><strong>Chance for publishing a paper:</strong> If however you find that the work
you do could lead to a publishable paper, you could work together
with the course instructor as coauthors to conduct such an
activity. However, this is going to be a significant effort and you
need to decide if you like to conduct this. In such cases if the
work is sufficient for publication submission, an A+ for the class
could be considered. It will be a lot of work. The length of such a
paper is typically 10-12 high quality pages including figures and
references. We may elect for the final submission to use a different
LaTeX style</li>

<div class="section" id="prerequisites">
<span id="ref-i524-prerequisits"></span><h2>Prerequisites<a class="headerlink" href="#prerequisites" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We expect you are familiar with:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>(easy) Linux or the Operating system on which you will focus your
deployment.</li>
<li>(moderate) Note that Windows as OS will not be sufficient as Ansible
is not supported on it. However you can use virtualbox or log onto
one of the clouds to get access to an OS that supports ansible.</li>
<li>(easy) Python 2.7.x (we will not use python 3 for this class as it
is not yet portable with all systems) (we consider learning python
as easy, however some students found it challenging)</li>
<li>(easy) pip</li>
<li>(easy) virtualenv</li>
<li>(easy) an editor (emacs, vi, jedit, pyCharm, eclipse, or other)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are not familiar with the technologies, we expect that you get
to know them during class. This may pose additional time commitment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="open-source-publication-of-homework">
<h2>Open Source Publication of Homework<a class="headerlink" href="#open-source-publication-of-homework" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As this class is about open source technologies, we will be using the
same to gather and distribute the homework submissions.</p>
<p>The results of all technology papers will be available as a single big
report. Due to the organization as a single report bound into a book
format of the technologies, all reports must be written in LaTeX and
jabref must be used to manage references. This class will therefore
not accept word, openoffice, and endnote. Alternatively lyx.org can be
used, if you prefer to edit latex in <em>what you see is almost what you
get</em> format. The use of sharelatex or overleave is allowed.</p>

<span id="index-1"></span><h2>How to achieve your best<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-achieve-your-best" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>While teaching our classes we noticed the following tips to achieve
your best:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Ask for help</strong></li>
<li>Do not <strong>Procrastinate</strong>.</li>
<li>Do not just <strong>take the other classes more serious</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Start the project in the first 4 weeks of the class</strong></li>
<li>Be aware that this class is not based on a text book and what this implies.</li>
<li>The TAs can schedule custom help office hours on appointment during reasonable times.</li>
<li>Do not overestimating the technical abilities.</li>
<li>Do not Underestimating the time it takes to do the project.</li>
<li>Unnecessarily struggling with LaTeX as you do not use an example we
provide and you want to do too much</li>
<li>Trying to do things on Windows which is typically more difficult
than using Linux</li>
<li>Not Having a computer that is up to date</li>
<li>Listening to the lectures</li>
<li>Ignoring security via ssh</li>
<li>Not posting passwords into git</li>
<li>Being not aware that git does <strong>not</strong> allow to easily completely
delete files that contain secret information such as passwords</li>
<li>Having your coleagues do the work for you</li>
<li>Underestimating the <strong>time</strong> it takes to do deployments</li>
<li>Not reading our piazza posts and repeating the same question over
and over</li>
<li>Not using Piazza to communicate as post in CANVAS will easily be
overlooked and are typically not shared with the class.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="piazza">
<h2>Piazza<a class="headerlink" href="#piazza" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>All communication will be done via Piazza. We will not read any e-mail
send to our university or private e-mails. All instructors are
following this rule. Any mail that is not send via Piazza will be
<strong>not read</strong> and <strong>deleted</strong>. This is also true for any mail send to
the inbox system in CANVAS. We found CANVAS a not scalable solution
for our class and will not use CANVAS for reaching out to you.   If you

<p>The classes are published online. Residential students at Indiana
University will participate in a discussion taking place at the
following time:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Monday 09:30am - 10:45am EST, I2 130</li>
</ul>
<p>For the 100% online students see the office hours.</p>

<div class="section" id="submissions">
<h2>Submissions<a class="headerlink" href="#submissions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Your papers and projects will be developed on GitHub and submitted
using <a class="reference internal" href="../lesson/prg/pull_requests.html"><span class="doc">Pull Requests</span></a>.  The process
is as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>fork the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/cloudmesh/sp17-i524">sp17-i524</a> repository.</li>
<li>clone your fork and commit and push your changes.</li>
<li>submit a pull request to the master branch of the origin repository.</li>
</ol>
<p>See the repository for details on the individual assignments. As it
will periodically be updated, make sure you are familiar with the
process of <a class="reference external" href="https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/">Syncing a fork</a>.</p>
<p>Some things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>space on github is limited, so do not add datasets to the
repository. Any datasets you use should be publicly hosted and
deployed as part of your project ansible deployment scripts.</li>
<li>never add ssh private keys to the repository. This results in a
security risk, possible point deductions, and lots of time and
effort to fix.</li>
<li>all work will be licensed under the Apache 2 open source license.</li>
<li>all submissions and discussion will be visible to the world.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="software-project">
<h2>Software Project<a class="headerlink" href="#software-project" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In case of a software project, we encourage a group project with up to
three members.  You can use the <strong>search teammate</strong> folder to find
and form groups:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://piazza.com/class/ix39m27czn5uw?cid=5">https://piazza.com/class/ix39m27czn5uw?cid=5</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The following artifacts are part of the deliverables for a project</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Code:</dt>
<dd>You must deliver the code in gitlab. The code must be compilable
and a TA may try to replicate to run your code. You MUST avoid
lengthy install descriptions and everything must be installable
from the command line. We will check submission. All team members
must be responsible for one part of the project.</dd>
<dt>Project Report:</dt>
<dd><p class="first">A report must be produced while using the format discussed in the
Report Format section. The following length is required:</p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li>4 pages, one student in the project</li>
<li>6 pages, two students in the project</li>
<li>8 pages, three students in the project</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Work Breakdown:</dt>
<dd><p class="first">This document is only needed for team projects. Include in the
appendix a short but sufficiently detailed work breakdown
documenting what the team has done. Back it up with commit
information from github.</p>
<p class="last">In addition the graders will go into github/lab, which provides a
history of checkins to verify each team member has used github/lab to
checkin their contributions frequently. E.g. if we find that one
of the students has not checked in code or documentation at all,
it will be questioned. An oral exam my be scheduled to verify that
the student has contributed to the project.</p>
</dd>
<dt>License: All projects are developed under an open source license such</dt>
<dd>as Apache 2.0 License. You will be required to add a LICENCE.txt
file and if you use other software identify how it can be reused
in your project. If your project uses different licenses, please
add in a README.md file which packages are used and which license
these packages have while adding a licenses file.</dd>

<h2>Code Repositories Deliverables<a class="headerlink" href="#code-repositories-deliverables" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Code repositories are for code, if you have additional libraries that
are needed you need to develop a script or use a DevOps framework to
install such software. Thus zip files and .class, .o files are not
permissible in the project. Each project must be reproducible with a
simple script. An example is:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">git</span> <span class="n">clone</span> <span class="o">....</span>
<span class="n">make</span> <span class="n">install</span>
<span class="n">make</span> <span class="n">run</span>
<span class="n">make</span> <span class="n">view</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Which would use a simple make file to install, run, and view the
results. Naturally you can use ansible or shell scripts. It is not
permissible to use GUI based DevOps preinstalled
frameworks. Everything must be installable form the command line.</p>

<h2>Academic Integrity Policy<a class="headerlink" href="#academic-integrity-policy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We take academic integrity very seriously. You are required to abide
by the Indiana University policy on academic integrity, as described
in the Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct, as well
as the Computer Science Statement on Academic Integrity
(<a class="reference external" href="http://www.soic.indiana.edu/doc/graduate/graduate-forms/Academic-Integrity-Guideline-FINAL-2015.pdf">http://www.soic.indiana.edu/doc/graduate/graduate-forms/Academic-Integrity-Guideline-FINAL-2015.pdf</a>). It
is your responsibility to understand these policies. Briefly
summarized, the work you submit for course assignments, projects,
quizzes, and exams must be your own or that of your group, if group
work is permitted. You may use the ideas of others but you must give
proper credit. You may discuss assignments with other students but you
must acknowledge them in the reference section according to scholarly
citation rules. Please also make sure that you know how to not
plagiarize text from other sources while reviewing citation rules.</p>
<p>We will respond to acts of plagiarism and academic misconduct
according to university policy. Sanctions typically involve a grade of
0 for the assignment in question and/or a grade of F in the course. In
addition, University policy requires us to report the incident to the
Dean of Students, who may apply additional sanctions, including
expulsion from the university.</p>
<p>Students agree that by taking this course, papers and source code
submitted to us may be subject to textual similarity review, for
example by Turnitin.com. These submissions may be included as source
documents in reference databases for the purpose of detecting
plagiarism of such papers or codes.</p>
<p>It is not acceptable to use for pay services to conduct your project.
Please be aware that we monitor such services and have TAs speaking
various languages and know about these services even in different
countries. Also do not just translate a report written by someone in a
different language and claim it to be your project.</p>
