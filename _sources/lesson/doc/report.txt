Report Format
=================

Over the years we got tired of student that asked us how many pages a
report needs to be and than turn around and play with spacing, fonts
and other space manipulations to circumvent these
recommendations. Thus we have adopted a much simpler approach. All
reports **must** be written in the same format that we define on this
page. Thus we require that the all reports and papers be written in
LaTeX while using our **trivial** example templates. 

The template for the report is available from:

* https://github.com/cloudmesh/classes/tree/master/docs/source/format/report

An example report in PDF format is available:

* `report.pdf <https://github.com/cloudmesh/classes/blob/master/docs/source/format/report/report.pdf>`_
  
It includes some very simple `makefile <https://github.com/cloudmesh/classes/blob/master/docs/source/format/report/Makefile>`_
and allows you to do editing with immediate preview as documented in
the LaTeX lesson.  Due to LaTeX being a trivial ASCII based format and
its superior bibliography management you wil save yourself many hours
of work. 




In case you are in a team, you can use either gitlab while
collaboratively developing the LaTeX document or use sharelatex or
overleaf.

Your final submission will include the bibliography file as a separate
document. All images must be placed in an images folder and submitted
in your repository with the originals.

.. warning:: There will be **NO EXCEPTION** to this format. Hence if
	     you do not know latex we recommend you get familiar with
	     it. Documents not written in LaTeX that do not follow the
	     specified format and are not accompanied by references
	     managed with jabref and are not spell checked will be
	     returned without review.

.. warning:: We found that students using MsWord or Google docs
	     produce generally inferior reports. Hence we no longer
	     accept reports using these tools and require that all
	     documents be written in LaTeX.
	     
Report Checklist
----------------

This incomplete list may serve as a way to check if you follow the rules

#. Have you written the report in LaTeX in the specified format?
#. Have you included an Acknowledgement section?
#. Have you included the report in gitlab?
#. Have you specified the HID, names, and e-mails of all team members in
   your report. E.g. the Real Names that are registered in Canvas?
#. Have you included the project number in the report?
#. Have you included all images in native and PDF format in gitlab in
   the images folder?
#. Have you added the bibliography file that you managed with jabref
#. Have you added an appendix describing who did what in the project
   or report?
#. Have you spellchecked the paper?
#. Have you made sure you do not plagiarize?
#. Have you not used phrases such as shown in the Figure below, but
   instead used as shown in Figure 3 when referring to the 3rd
   figure?
#. Have you capitalizezed "Figure 3", "Table 1", ... ?
#. Any figure that is not referred to explicitly in the text must be
   removed?
#. Are the figure captions bellow the figures and not on top. (Do
   not include the titles of the figures but instead use the caption
  or that information?
#. When using tables put the table caption on top?
#. Make the figures large enough so we can see it, regardless of page
   restrictions. If needed make the figure over two columns?
#. Do not worry about the figure placement if they are at a different
   location than you think. Figures are allowed to float. If you want
   you can place all figures at the end of the report?
#. Do not use the word "I"?
#. Do not artificially inflate your report if you are bellow the page
   limit and have nothing to say anymore?
#. If your paper limit is 12 pages but you want to hand in 120 pages,
   please check first with an instructor ;-)
#. Check in your current work of the report on a weekly basis to show
   consistent progress?
#. Is in your report directory a README.rst file in it as shown in the
   example project that we introduced you to?



Exercise
--------

Report.1:
  Install latex and jabref on your system

Report.2:
  Check out the project-000 example directory. Create a PDF and view
  it. Modify and recompile.

Report.4:
  Learn about the different formats in bibtex

Report.5:
  What is an article in Report?

Report.6:
  What is an InProceedings and how does it differ from Conference?

Report.7:  
  What is a Misc?

Report.8:
  Why are spaces, underscores in directory names
  problematic for Report and why should you avoid using them for your projects

Report.9:
  Write an objective report about the advantages and disadvantages of
  programs to write reports.
