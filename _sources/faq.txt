FAQ
====

The university says there are no prerequisites for the class, what are the prerequisites?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have communicated the prerequisites clearly to the
university. Apparently, they forgot to add them to the class.
The perquisites can be found in the appropriate class
overview. Please review them carefully.

For I524 you find them at:

* https://cloudmesh.github.io/classes/i524/index.html#prerequisites

Why is this class not hosted on EdX?
------------------------------------

I523 and I524 were the first classes hosted on EdX. We wanted to
continue offering them on EdX. However, the university system
administrators mentioned to us that their systems are not ready to
support this class in EdX. Unfortunately, this is out of our control
and we hope that the university will soon update to an EdX system that
can host our classes.

Why are you not using CANVAS for communicating with students?
-------------------------------------------------------------

It has been proven that CANVAS communication is an inferior
communication system and can not compete with piazza's group
communication features. As we adopt state of the art technologies, we
like to expose you to state of the art communication tools such as
piazza, instead of using technologies that have shown not to support
our communication pathways that we use in class.

Why are you using github for submitting projects and papers?
------------------------------------------------------------

This class is about open source technology and we like that you benefit
from material others in the class are developing or have developed. All
assignments are openly submitted to the class github for everyone to
see. As part of the goal of this class is to develop reusable
deployments. Such reuse is only possible if the code is publicly
available and others can benefit from it.

The technology papers are made accessible so you can read other
technology papers and can get an introduction in technologies that you
may not yet know about. It also allows others to contribute to your
technology papers and improve them.


I am full time student at IUPUI. Can I take the online version?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Yes you can.

If you are an international student, I suggest you verify this with
the office and the registrar. There may be some restrictions for
international students. Also some degree programs may have a limit or
do not allow to take online classes. It will be up to you to verify
the requirements with the appropriate administrators.

I am a residential student at IU. Can I take the online version only?
--------------------------------------------------------------

We recommend you take the residential class.

If you are an international student or a student of a particular
degree program restrictions may be placed in if and how many online
courses you can take. It will be up to you to contact the appropriate
administrative departments including the international student office
to verify what is allowed for you. In general international students
have such restrictions. Please find out what they are and which
section of the course is appropriate for you. 

The class is full what do I do?
-------------------------------

#. Make sure to put yourself on the waiting list.
#. If you are a residential student show up on the first class in the
   specified lecture room. More likely than not some students wil
   enroll in more classes than they can do and places will free up. We
   will create a list and discuss with the registrar what to do.
   
Do I need to buy a textbook?
----------------------------

No, the resources will be provided for every unit. However, we
recommend that you identify useful books for the class that can help
you. Examples include

#. “Taming The Big Data Tidal Wave: Finding Opportunities in Huge Data
   Streams with Advanced Analytics”, Bill Franks Wiley ISBN:
   978-1-118-20878-6
#. “Doing Data Science: Straight Talk from the Frontline”, Cathy O'Neil,
   Rachel Schutt, O'Reilly Media, ISBN 978-1449358655

If you find good books, wil like to add them here.
   
Do I need a computer to participate in this class?
--------------------------------------------------

Obviously if you are an online student you do need a computer. If you
are a residential student the facilities provided by SOIC will be
sufficient. However, as you study involves computers, its probably
important to evaluate if a computer will make your work easier. 

If it comes to what computer to buy we really do not have a good
recommendation as this depends on your budget. A computer running
Linux or OSX makes programming probably easier. A windows computer has
the advantage of also being able to run Word and ppt (so does OSX). A
cheap machine with multiple cores and sufficient memory (16GB+) is a
good idea. A SSD will make access to data especially if large data
snappy.

For this reason I myself use a Mac, but you probably can get much
cheaper machines with similar specs elsewhere.

Other students bought themselves a cheap computer and installed Linux
on it so they do not interfere with their work machines or with
Windows. Given how inexpensive computers these days are this may be a
reasonable idea. However, do not go too cheap have enough memory and
use an SSD if you can.

Which bibliography manager is required for the class?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

We require you use jabref:

Can I use endnote or other bibliography managers?
-------------------------------------------------

No. However, if you want to make your life much more
complicated. Jabref is best for us and we do require that you hand in
all bibliographies while cleaning and transferring them to jabref. We
will not accept any other bibliography tool such as:
   
#. `http://endnote.com/ <http://endnote.com/>`_

How many hours will this course take to work on every week?
-----------------------------------------------------------

This question can not rely be answered precisely. Typically we have
2-3 hours video per week. However starting from that its difficult to
put a real number down as things may also depend on your background.

* The programming load is modest, but requires knowledge in python
  which you may have to learn outside of this class.

* Some students have more experience than others, thus it may be
  possible to put in 6 hours per week overall, but other may have to
  put in 12 hours, while yet others may enjoy this class so much that
  they spend a lot more hours.

* We will certainly not stopping you form spending time in the class.
  It will be up to you to figure out how much time you will spend.

* Please remember that procrastination will not pay of in this class.
  
* The project or term paper will take a significant amount of time.

Is all classes material final?
------------------------------

No. Class material can change. Please remember that in a normal class
you will be given several hours of lectures a week. They will be
released on a weekly basis. What we do here is to release the material
as much as possible upfront and **correct** them when we find it
necessary to provide improvements or additions. In addition we learn
actually from you based on your feedback and we integrate this
feedback into the classes. Naturally if you find errors to this class
Web page or have additions that you want to integrate, we would like
to hear from you. Pull requests can be issued by you so your
contributions get acknowledged and rewarded as part of the grade.

I want everything perfect and no changes on the Web pages
---------------------------------------------------------

This class is not for you. The world is build around improvements.
Not integrating suggestions from other students or learning from their
experience will hinder your progress and you will not be able to
achieve your best. Furthermore you would stagnate.

The changes we make are typically not substantial and are typically
errata or clarification of content.

I prefer a textbook
-------------------

This class is not for you. We have on purpose not identified a text
book as a textbook about the topics we teach would be too quickly
outdated and do not allow the flexibility to integrate new content.

What lectures should I learn when?
----------------------------------

The class is structured in lectures that you can listen to at any
time. If you have difficulties with organizing your own calendar, we
will develop a sample calendar for you. Please contact us. However we
have undergraduates, graduates, residential and online students. We
even have students that can only work part of the semester while they
use their vacation. Hence, it is impossible for us to provide an exact
calendar that satisfies all the different types of students. Hence we
appeal to your organizational skills to create a "study" plan for you
during the first week of the semester that works for you.

We recommend to do the theory lectures as quickly as possible, but
also start learning ansible at the same time as this will be part of
your project. You will fail if you assume you can do the project in 2
weeks. You will need to work on it all semester long on weekly basis,
starting with learning how to use ansible and cloud resources.

I524: Why are you doing the papers?
--------------------------------------------

Part of doing research is to communicate your thoughts on topics and
to be able to analyze and evaluate technologies that may or may not be
useful for you. Our goal within this class is for the first time to
gather a significant portion of the technologies that you hear about
in class and that you get exposed to as part of the technology list
into a "proceedings" organized by all students in class. The papers
serve also the dual purpose of you learning how to write a paper and
use bibliographies.

I524: Why are there no homework to test me on skills such as ansible or python?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We used to do smaller homework in previous classes to evaluate you on
your skills. However we found that they were rather ineffective. There
are two reasons for this:

1. the assignments given are typically toy assignments and are not
   reflecting real world scenarios.
2. the assignments take effectively away time for your project that
   you could spend directly on your project

However, we can provide you with ungraded homework that you can
conduct to test your skills if you like. Please let us know if you
like to do that and we can assign such homework to you.

I524: Why not use chef or another DevOps framework?
---------------------------------------------------

We used to use chef and other DevOps frameworks. However we found that
for a class grading can not be uniformly conducted while using too
many frameworks. We also found that the value of learning on how to
collaboratively contribute as part of an opensource class was
diminished while a small group were choosing other technologies. These
groups complained later on that they had too much work and could not
benefit from other students. Hence we make is simple. All DevOps must
be provided in ansible. All programming must be provided in python if
not an explicit reason exist to use another language or technology
such as R or technologies such as neo4j. However all deployment must
be done in python and ansible.

I am not able to attend the online hours
----------------------------------------

Typically we provide many different times for meetings via Zoom. We
even schedule within reason special sessions. All of them are however
in EST. If you are an international online student and expect us to be
awake at 3am in the morning to talk to you, this class is not for
you. Please adjust your schedule.

Do I need to attend the online sessions?
----------------------------------------

No. But you can ask any question you want. We found that in previous
classes that some students clearly benefitted from online sessions.
If you attend them make sure you have a working and tested microphone
if possible.

What are the leaning outcomes?
------------------------------

Are hey not clearly stated as part of the course? If not help us
improving them at the beginning of the semester while asking questions
on Piazza? If you complain at the end of the class about it shows
you have not taken advantage of the class and not interacted with us
enough.


There are so many messages on Piazza I can not keep up.
-------------------------------------------------------

This is not true. Residential students typically also participate in
live lectures in which we discuss with each other important
aspects. As an online class may not have such a lecture, the piazza
posts are just a replacement of them. It is required that you read all
posts and decide which of them are relevant for you. In a lecture room
you will find also that one student asks a question, while the
professor answers the question to the entire class. In such a lecture
the professor is not walking up to the student and whispers the answer
in just the ear of the student that asks the question. In the same way
we will answer questions in general to all students.

There are so many announcements on Piazza I can not keep up.
------------------------------------------------------------

This is not true. Residential students typically also participate in
live lectures in which we announce important
aspects. As an online class may not have such a lecture, the piazza
posts are just a replacement of them. It is required that you read all
posts and decide which of them are relevant for you. In a lecture room
you will find also that we do not walk from student to student and
whisper the announcement into the ear of every student separately. We
would not have enough time to do so. Instead we just announce it to
all students.

I find the hosting Web confusing
------------------------------------

Once in a while we find that a student finds the hosting of the class
material on the class Web page confusing. This confusion can be
overcome by doing the following:

1. You may have to take time to explore the Web page and identify what
   needs to be done for the class. However each class has a clear
   overview page.
2. You may have to learn to get used to a class that allows you to work
   ahead. 
3. You may have to learn to appreciate the additional material that
   assist in learning about python, ansible, LaTex, or the many other
   topics
4. Please do not blame the instructors for things that are out of
   their control: You may not be aware that it is not the instructors
   fault that the university is not able to provide us with an EdX
   server that works for us. Our choice would be to use EdX.

   
I524: I do not know python. What do I do?
-----------------------------------------

This class requires python. Please learn it. We will be using ansible
for the project. This you can acquire as part of the class through
self study.
