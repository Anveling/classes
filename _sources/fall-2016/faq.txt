FAQ

I am full time student at IUPUI? Can I take the online version?
---------------------------------------------------------------

I suggest you verify this with the international student office and
the registrar if you are an international student. There may be some
restrictions for international students. Also some degree programs may
have a limit or do not allow to take online classes. It will be up to
you to verify the requirements with the appropriate administrators.

I am a residential student can I take the online version only?
--------------------------------------------------------------

If you are an international student or a student of a particular
degree program restrictions may be placed in if and how many online
courses you can take. It will be up to you to contact the appropriate
administrative departments including the international student office
to verify what is allowed for you. In general international students
have such restrictions. Please find out what they are and which
section of the course is appropriate for you. 


Do I need to buy a textbook?
----------------------------

No, the resources will be provided for every unit. However, there are
some optional textbooks if you would like to purchase one.

#. “Taming The Big Data Tidal Wave: Finding Opportunities in Huge Data
   Streams with Advanced Analytics”, Bill Franks Wiley ISBN:
   978-1-118-20878-6
#. “Doing Data Science: Straight Talk from the Frontline”, Cathy O'Neil,
   Rachel Schutt, O'Reilly Media, ISBN 978-1449358655

Do I need a computer to participate in this class?
--------------------------------------------------

Obviously if you are an online student you do need a computer. If you
are a residential student the facilities provided by SOIC will be
sufficient. However, as you study involves computers, its probably
important to evaluate if a computer will make your work easier. 

If it comes to what computer to buy we really do not have a good
recommendation as this depends on your budget. A computer running
Linux or OSX makes programming probably easier. A windows computer has
the advantage of also being able to run Word and ppt. A cheap machine
with multiple cores and sufficient memory (4GB+) is a good idea. A SSD
will make access to data especially if large data snappy.

For this reason I myself use a Mac, but you probably can get much
cheaper machines with similar specs elsewhere.

How many hours will this course take to work on every week?
-----------------------------------------------------------

This question can not rely be answered precisely. Typically we have
2-3 hours video per week. However starting from that its difficult to
put a real number down as things amy also depend on your background.

* The programming load is modest, but requires knowledge in python
  which you may have to learn outside of this class.

* Some students have more experience than others, thus it may be
  possible to put in 6 hours per week overall, but other may have to
  put in 12 hours, while yet others may enjoy this class so much that
  they spend a lot more hours.

* We will certainly not stopping you form spending time in the class.
  It will be up to you to figure out how much time you willl spend.

* Please remem ber that procrastenation will not pay of in this class.
  
* The project or term paper will take a significant amount of time.
