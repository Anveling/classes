Tips
----

1. Why do I not see that my changes are published on the Web page?

   Changes will take time to be reviewed and integrated into the Web
   page. Changes will be done in two steps. Firts they will be merged
   into the branch I524, after some time they will be merged into the
   master branch. Only after they are in the master branch they will
   be visible. 

2. How do I know if I did it right?

   Take a look at https://github.com/cloudmesh/classes/pulls
   If your changes are already integrated you are fine, if they are
   not, you shoudl see your pull request in the given link

Learning outcomes
-----------------

1. CANVAS is not a tool used in opensource development and
   industry. It has limitations in scalability and in structuring
   effective communication with large numbers of
   students/collaborators.

   Instead we use industry accepted github for homework submission. To
   showcase one way of collaborating with more than 70 collaborators
   we will use the class Web page to demonstrate how this can be
   achieved with forks and pull requests. The TAs are responsible fo
   communication tou you how to do this and are also organizing the
   merge of your pull riquests into the Matsre Web page.

2. As you look over the list you get familiar with technologies of
   interest.

3. You will learn how not to plaguarize

4. You will learn how to create proper refernces for Web-pages while
   using academic bibliography management tools.
