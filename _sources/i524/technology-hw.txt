   Changes will take time to be reviewed and integrated into the Web
   page. Changes will be done in two steps. Firts they will be merged
   into the branch I524, after some time they will be merged into the
   master branch. Only after they are in the master branch they will
   be visible. 

2. How do I know if I did it right?
