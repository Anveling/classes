I524 Lectures
=============

.. warning:: This page is under construction, but most lectures are
	     already available. All tracks will change
	     considerably. If you want to work ahead, start with the
	     theory track.

.. warning:: Lectures listed on this page will be ready for review
	     when they are marked as released. If they are not
	     released they will be updated as part of the
	     class. However instead of waiting for the release, we
	     have opted to show you our current draft lectures.
	     
Based on our experience with residential and online classes we will
for the first time not require that you have to do the class videos at
a prticular time once they are released. This however has the danger
that you are not watching them at all and you cheat yourself as you do
not allow yourself the educational lessons that this class offers to
you. It also requires you to assemble your own schedule for watching
the videos that will have to be managed through github as part of a
README.md file in your git repository. You will need to do the
technology track, the communications track, as well as the theory
track.
	     

Theory Track:
   Some lectures have been designed to introduce you to a
   number of technologies. These lectures are of more theoretical
   nature and do not require much hands on activities. THus you can
   start them any time.

Collaboration Track:
   These lectures provide the tools for you to collaborate with your
   peers and with instructors.

Systems Track:
   These lectures cover topics that are fundamental to executing your
   project.

Technology Track:
   These are lectures with strong technology content and
   introduce you to using a selected number of technologies as part of
   the class. It is expected that you will use them as part of the
   project. Instead of slowing you down with graded homework we expect
   that you learn these technologies and reuse them as part of the
   project. It would be a big mistake to start the project 2 weeks
   befor the semester ends, you will not succeed. You must start your
   project in the first month of the course. Progress is reported on
   monthly basis while the report is updated and snapshot every
   month. We will monitor your
   progress and include them into the discussion grade. For
   residential students ther should be no reason why you can not
   provide a monthly update. For online students a valid update would
   be: "I changed my company and could not work on the project due to
   moving". This will give you some points if submitted in
   time. However, if you submit nothing, we will not issue any points.
