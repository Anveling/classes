Details for the TechList Homework
=================================

1. Watch the video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi7vezNmfo

2. Create a fork into your local repo

    Go to https://cloudmesh.github.io/classes/ and click on “Fork me on GitHub” 
    to create a fork into your local repo
   
3. Make sure you start your commit summary with your "new:usr: ...." only this
   way you get credit for he assignment. Make sure your references have
   an owner filed. make sure you do not put urls in howpublished for a MISC

   ... is a meaningful summary of what you did

   Every reference is required to have an owner field (for example: owner     = {TA-sp17-0001})

   In case your entry is MISC the howpublished field refers to the
   method on how it is published. A url is not allowed ( for example
   howpublished = {Web Page})
   
4. Make sure to remove advertisement adjectives and sentences

5. Make sure you spellcheck

6. Make sure you rebase or pull before you commit

7. Change the description in technology.rst

8. Add the reference in refs.bib  

9. compile

10. review compile

11. commit if correct
    
12.  create a pull request (check if no new content conflict with yours)

Tips
----

1. Why do I not see that my changes are published on the Web page?

   Changes will take time to be reviewed and integrated into the Web
   page. Changes will be done in two steps. First they will be merged
   into the branch I524, after some time they will be merged into the
   master branch. Only after they are in the master branch they will
   be visible. 

2. How do I know if I did it right?

   Take a look at https://github.com/cloudmesh/classes/pulls
   If your changes are already integrated you are fine, if they are
   not, you should see your pull request in the given link

Learning outcomes
-----------------

1. CANVAS is not a tool used in opensource development and
   industry. It has limitations in scalability and in structuring
   effective communication with large numbers of
   students/collaborators.

   Instead we use industry accepted github for homework submission. To
   showcase one way of collaborating with more than 70 collaborators
   we will use the class Web page to demonstrate how this can be
   achieved with forks and pull requests. The TAs are responsible fo
   communication tou you how to do this and are also organizing the
   merge of your pull requests into the Master Web page.

2. As you look over the list you get familiar with technologies of
   interest.

3. You will learn how not to plagiarize

4. You will learn how to create proper references for Web-pages while
   using academic bibliography management tools.
