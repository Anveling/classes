Report Format
=================

Over the years we got tired of student that asked us how many pages a
report needs to be and than turn around and play with spacing, fonts
and other space manipulations to circumvent these recommendations. Thus
we have adopted a much simpler approach. All reports **must** be
written in the same 2 column ACM style format.  The format is
available as word or LaTeX template, however we recommend that you
remove the copyright block on the first page. A modified template in
LaTeX is available at the following location:

* https://gitlab.com/cloudmesh/project-000/tree/master/report

It also includes some very simple makefile and allows you to do
editing with immediate preview as documented in the LaTeX lesson.
LaTeX is the preferred format du to superior reference management.
   
If you rely like to make your life more difficult you are also
allowed in some cases to use Word.

.. note::
   please check your class rules
   stated in the overview. Dependent on the class you may not be able to
   use word.

The MSWord template
can be found here:

* :download:`paper-report.docx <files/paper-report.docx>`

The original format can be found here. It includes also a document
with many good tips:

* https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template


There will be **NO EXCEPTION** to this format. In case you are in a
team, you can use either gitlab while collaboratively developing the
LaTeX document or use MicrosoftOne Drive which allows collaborative
editing features. All bibliographical entries must be put into jabref
regardless if you use word or LaTeX.  This will
guarantee that you follow proper citation styles. You can use either
ACM or IEEE reference styles. Your final submission will include the
bibliography file as a separate document.

Documents that do not follow the ACM format and are not accompanied by
references managed with jabref or endnote or are not spell checked
will be returned without review.

Report Checklist
----------------

This incomplete list may serve as a way to check if you follow the rules

:|box|:
   Have you written the report in word or LaTeX in the specified
   format.

:|box|:
   In case of LaTeX, have you removed the ACM copyright information
   (see project-000 for an example how to do this)

:|box|:  Have you included the report in gitlab.
:|box|:  Have you specified the HID, names, and e-mails of all team members in
  your report. E.g. the username in Canvas.
:|box|:  Have you included the project number in the report
:|box|:  Have you included all images in native and PDF format in gitlab
  in the images folder.
:|box|:  Have you added the bibliography file that you managed with
  jabref
:|box|:  Have you submitted an additional page that describes who did
  what in the project or report.
:|box|:  Have you spellchecked the paper.
:|box|:  Have you made sure you do not plagiarize.
:|box|:  Have you not used phrases such as shown in the Figure below,
         but instead used as shown in Figure 3 when referring to the 3rd
         figure.
:|box|: Any figure that is not referred to explicitly in the text must
	be removed.  
:|box|:  Are the Figure captions bellow the figures and not on top. (Do
  not include the titles of the figures but instead use the caption
  for that information
:|box|:  When using tables put the table caption on top
:|box|:  Make the figures large enough so we can see it, regardless of
  page restrictions. If needed make the figure over two columns
:|box|: Do not worry about the figure placement if they are at a different
  location than you think. Figures are allowed to float. If you want
  you can place all figures at the end of the report
:|box|: Do not use the word "I"
:|box|: Do not artificially inflate your report if you are bellow the
	page limit and have nothing to say anymore.
   
:|box|: If your paper limit is 12 pages but you want to hand in 120
	pages, please check first with an instructor ;-)

:|box|: Check in your current work of the report on a weekly basis to
	show consistent progress. 	

:|box|: Is in your report directory a README.rst file in it as shown
	in the example project-000 that we introduced you to.
