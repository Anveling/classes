<p>I523 and I524 were the first classes hosted on EdX. We wanted to
continue offering them on EdX. However, the university system
administrators mentioned to us that their systems are not ready to
support this class in EdX. Unfortunately, this is out of our control

<p>This class is about open source technology and we like that you benefit
from material others in the class are developing or have developed. All
assignments are openly submitted to the class github for everyone to
see. As part of the goal of this class is to develop reusable
deployments. Such reuse is only possible if the code is publicly
available and others can benefit from it.</p>
<p>The technology papers are made accessible so you can read other
technology papers and can get an introduction in technologies that you
may not yet know about. It also allows others to contribute to your
technology papers and improve them.</p>

<p>Yes you can.</p>
<p>If you are an international student, I suggest you verify this with
the office and the registrar. There may be some restrictions for
international students. Also some degree programs may have a limit or
do not allow to take online classes. It will be up to you to verify
the requirements with the appropriate administrators.</p>

<p>We recommend you take the residential class.</p>
<p>If you are an international student or a student of a particular
degree program restrictions may be placed in if and how many online
courses you can take. It will be up to you to contact the appropriate
administrative departments including the international student office
to verify what is allowed for you. In general international students
have such restrictions. Please find out what they are and which
section of the course is appropriate for you.</p>

<p>No, the resources will be provided for every unit. However, we
recommend that you identify useful books for the class that can help
you. Examples include</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>“Taming The Big Data Tidal Wave: Finding Opportunities in Huge Data
Streams with Advanced Analytics”, Bill Franks Wiley ISBN:
978-1-118-20878-6</li>
<li>“Doing Data Science: Straight Talk from the Frontline”, Cathy O&#8217;Neil,
Rachel Schutt, O&#8217;Reilly Media, ISBN 978-1449358655</li>

<div class="section" id="why-is-there-no-textbook">
<h2>Why is there no textbook?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-is-there-no-textbook" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We cover a wide range of topics and their subject-matter is constantly

publishing.</p>

<div class="section" id="do-i-need-a-computer-to-participate-in-this-class">
<h2>Do I need a computer to participate in this class?<a class="headerlink" href="#do-i-need-a-computer-to-participate-in-this-class" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you are an online student you need access to a computer. If you
are a residential student the facilities provided by SOIC will be
sufficient. However, as you study involves computers, its probably
important to evaluate if a computer will make your work easier.</p>
<p>If it comes to what computer to buy we really do not have a good
recommendation as this depends on your budget. A computer running
Linux or OSX makes programming probably easier. A windows computer has
the advantage of also being able to run Word and ppt (so does OSX). A
cheap machine with multiple cores and sufficient memory (16GB+) is a
good idea. A SSD will make access to data especially if large data
snappy.</p>
<p>For this reason I myself use a Mac, but you probably can get much
cheaper machines with similar specs elsewhere.</p>
<p>Other students bought themselves a cheap computer and installed Linux
on it so they do not interfere with their work machines or with
Windows. Given how inexpensive computers these days are this may be a
reasonable idea. However, do not go too cheap have enough memory and
use an SSD if you can.</p>

<p>This question can not rely be answered precisely. Typically we have
2-3 hours video per week. However starting from that its difficult to
put a real number down as things may also depend on your background.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The programming load is modest, but requires knowledge in python and
linux systems which you may have to learn outside of this class.</li>
<li>Some students have more experience than others, thus it may be
possible to put in 6 hours per week overall, but other may have to
put in 12 hours, while yet others may enjoy this class so much that
they spend a lot more hours.</li>
<li>We will certainly not stopping you form spending time in the class.
It will be up to you to figure out how much time you will spend.</li>
<li>Please remember that procrastination will not pay of in this class.</li>
<li>The project or term paper will take a significant amount of time.</li>

<div class="section" id="is-all-classes-material-final">
<h2>Is all classes material final?<a class="headerlink" href="#is-all-classes-material-final" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>No. Class material can change. Please remember that in a normal class
you will be given several hours of lectures a week. They will be
released on a weekly basis. What we do here is to release the material
as much as possible upfront and <strong>correct</strong> them when we find it
necessary to provide improvements or additions. Additionally, we
integrate your feedback into the classes. If you find errors on the
class Web page or have additions that you want to add, we would like
to hear from you. Pull requests can be issued by you so your
contributions get acknowledged and rewarded as part of the grade.</p>

<h2>What are the changes to the web page?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-the-changes-to-the-web-page" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

<h2>What lectures should I learn when?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-lectures-should-i-learn-when" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The class is structured in lectures that you can listen to at any
time. If you have difficulties with organizing your own calendar, we
will develop a sample calendar for you. Please contact us. However we
have undergraduates, graduates, residential and online students. We
even have students that can only work part of the semester while they
use their vacation. Hence, it is impossible for us to provide an exact
calendar that satisfies all the different types of students. Hence we
appeal to your organizational skills to create a &#8220;study&#8221; plan for you
during the first week of the semester that works for you.</p>
<p>We recommend to do the theory lectures as quickly as possible, but
also start learning ansible at the same time as this will be part of
your project. You will fail if you assume you can do the project in 2
weeks. You will need to work on it all semester long on weekly basis,
starting with learning how to use ansible and cloud resources.</p>

<h2>I524: Why are you doing the papers?<a class="headerlink" href="#i524-why-are-you-doing-the-papers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Part of doing research is to communicate your thoughts on topics and
to be able to analyze and evaluate technologies that may or may not be
useful for you. Our goal within this class is for the first time to
gather a significant portion of the technologies that you hear about
in class and that you get exposed to as part of the technology list
into a &#8220;proceedings&#8221; developed by all students in class. The papers
serve also the dual purpose of you learning how to write a paper and
use bibliographies.</p>

<p>We used to do smaller homework in previous classes to evaluate you on
your skills. However we found that they did not reflect real-world use
cases. By focusing on the project instead, you will be forced to
develop these skills.</p>
<p>However, we can provide you with additional ungraded homework that you
can conduct to test your skills if you like. Please let us know if you
like to do that and we can assign such homework to you.</p>

<h2>I524: Why not use chef or another DevOps framework?<a class="headerlink" href="#i524-why-not-use-chef-or-another-devops-framework" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We used to use chef and other DevOps frameworks. However we found that
for a class grading can not be uniformly conducted while using too
many frameworks. We also found that the value of learning on how to
collaboratively contribute as part of an opensource class was
diminished while a small group were choosing other technologies. These
groups complained later on that they had too much work and could not
benefit from other students. Hence we make is simple. All DevOps must
be provided in ansible. All programming must be provided in python if
not an explicit reason exist to use another language or technology
such as R or technologies such as neo4j. However all deployment must
be done in python and ansible.</p>

<h2>There are so many messages on Piazza I can not keep up.<a class="headerlink" href="#there-are-so-many-messages-on-piazza-i-can-not-keep-up" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Residential students typically participate in live lectures in which
we discuss with each other important aspects of a topic. As an online
class may not have such a lecture, the piazza posts are just a
replacement of them. It is required that you read the posts and decide
which of them are relevant for you. In a lecture room you will find
also that one student asks a question, while the professor answers the

<h2>I find the hosting Web confusing<a class="headerlink" href="#i-find-the-hosting-web-confusing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once in a while we find that a student finds the hosting of the class
material on the class Web page confusing. This confusion can be
overcome by doing the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>You may have to take time to explore the Web page and identify what
needs to be done for the class. However each class has a clear
overview page.</li>
<li>You may have to learn to get used to a class that allows you to work
ahead.</li>
<li>You may have to learn to appreciate the additional material that
assist in learning about python, ansible, LaTex, or the many other
topics</li>
<li>Please do not blame the instructors for things that are out of
