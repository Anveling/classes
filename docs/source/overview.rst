Getting Access and Systems Support
----------------------------------------------------------------------

For some projects you will need access to a cloud. We recommend you
evaluate which cloud would be most appropriate for your project. This
includes:

* chameleoncloud.org
* furturesystems.org
* AWS (you will be responsible for charges)
* Azure (you will be responsible for charges)
* virtualbox if you have a powerful computer and like to prototype
* other clouds

We intend to make some small number of virtual machines available for
us in a project FG511 on FutureSystems:

* https://portal.futuresystems.org/projects/511

Once you created an account on FutureSystems and you do a project YOu
can add yourself to the project so you gain access.

Systems staff is available only during regular business hours Mo-Fri 10am - 4pm.

We will have a Section in the class material about these resources.

.. todo:: Hyungro. add the link to the section and prepare this section.
:ref:`OpenStack FutureSystems <ref-quickstart_openstack>`

You could also use the cloudmesh client software on Linux and OSX to
access multiple clouds in easy fashion. A Section will introduce this
software.



Term Paper or Project
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You have a choice to write a term paper or do a software project using
our cloud computing test bed.

In case of a software project, we encourage a group project with up to three members.

You can use the discussion TBD Â to form project teams or just communicate
privately with other class members to formulate a team.

.. todo:: include a link to the discussion for formulating projects.

The following artifacts are part of the deliverables

.. todo:: Hyungro. include paper/report length requirement as RST table

* Template: ACM Proceedings - `WORD <https://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/pubform.doc>`_
* 9 point fonts in two column page
* Software Project: 3-4 pages
* Paper Project: 6 pages (individual)
    - 9 pages (two members)
    - 12 pages (three members)

This needs also to be provided for Papers that are written in a team.



Report Format
---------------

All reports will be using the ACM proceedings format. The MSWord template
can be found here:

* :download:`paper-report.docx <files/paper-report.docx>`

A LaTeX version can be found at

* https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template

however you have to remove the ACM copyright notice in the LaTeX version.

There will be **NO EXEPTION** to this format. In case you are in a
team, you can use either gitlab while collaboratively developing the
LaTeX document or use MicrosoftOne Drive which allows collaborative
editing features. All bibliographical entries must be put into a
bibliography manager such as jabref, endnote, or Mendeley. This will
guarantee that you follow proper citation styles. You can use either
ACM or IEEE reference styles. Your final submission will include the
bibliography file as a separate document.

Documents that do not follow the ACM format and are not accompanied by
references managed with jabref or endnote will be returned without
review.

Report Checklist:

* [ ] Have you written the report in word or LaTeX in the specified
  format
* [ ] In case of LaTeX, have you removed the ACM copyright information
* [ ] Have you included the report in gitlab
* [ ] Have you specified the names and e-mails of all team members in
  your report.
* [ ] have you included all images in native and PDF format in gitlab
  in the images folder
* [ ] have you added the bibliography file (such as endnote or bibtex
  file e.g. jabref) in a directory bib
* [ ] have you submitted an additional page that describes who did
  what in the project or report.


Code Repositories Deliverables
------------------------------

Code repositories are for code, if you have additional libraries that
are needed you need to develop a script or use a DevOps framework to
install such software. Thus zip files and .class, .o files are not
permissible in the project. Each project must be reproducible with a
simple script. An example is

    git clone ....
    make install
    make run
    make view

Which would use a simple make file to install, run, and view the
results. Naturally you can use ansible or shell scripts. It is not
permissible to use GUI based DevOps preinstalled
frameworks. Everything must be installable form the command line.


Prerequisites
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Python or Java experience (programming load is modest). 

In case you elect a programming project we will assume that you are
familiar with the programming languages required as part of the
project you suggest. We will limit the languages to Python, Java, and
JavaScript.  If you do not know the required technologies, we will
expect you to learn it outside of class. For example, Python has a
reputation for being easy to learn, and those with strong programming
background in another general-purpose programming language (like
C/C++, Java, Ruby, etc.) can learn it within a few days. Please
consult the instructor if you have concerns about your programming
background. In addition, we may encounter math of various kinds,
including linear 1 algebra, probability theory, and basic calculus. We
students with limited math backgrounds may need to do additional
reading outside of class.

In case you are interested in further development of cloudmesh for big
data strong Python or JavaScript experience is needed.


Learning Outcomes
-----------------

Students will gain broad understanding of Big Data application areas and
approaches used. This course is a good preparation for any student
likely to be involved with Big Data in their future.


Grading
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Grading for homework will be done within a week for submission on due
date. For homework that were submitted beyond the due date, the grading
will be done within 2-3 weeks after the submission. Some homework can
not be delivered late and a 10% grade reduction will be given. We will
be clearly mark such mandatory deadlines.

It is the studentâs responsibility to upload submissions well ahead of
the deadline to avoid last minute problems with network connectivity,
browser crashes, cloud issues, etc. It is a very good idea to make
early submissions and then upload updates as the deadline approaches;
we will grade the last submission received before the deadline.

Note that paper and project will take a considerable time and doing
proper time management is a must for this class.

Licensing
---------

All projects are developed under an open source license such as Apache
2.0 License, or similar. You will be required to add a License file
and if you use other software identify how it can be reused in your
project.

Academic Integrity Policy
----------------------------------------------------------------------

We take academic integrity very seriously. You are required to abide
by the Indiana University policy on academic integrity, as described
in the Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct, as well
as the Computer Science Statement on Academic Integrity
(http://www.soic.indiana.edu/doc/graduate/graduate-forms/Academic-Integrity-Guideline-FINAL-2015.pdf). It
is your responsibility to understand these policies. Briefly
summarized, the work you submit for course assignments, projects,
quizzes, and exams must be your own or that of your group, if
groupwork is permitted. You may use the ideas of others but you must
give proper credit. You may discuss assignments with other students
but you must acknowledge them in the reference section according to
scholarly citation rules. Please also make sure that you know how to
not plagerise text from other sources while reviewing citation rules.

We will respond to acts of plagiarism and academic misconduct
according to university policy. Sanctions typically involve a grade of
0 for the assignment in question and/or a grade of F in the course. In
addition, University policy requires us to report the incident to the
Dean of Students, who may apply additional sanctions, including
expulsion from the university.

Students agree that by taking this course, papers and source code
submitted to us may be subject to textual similarity review, for
example by Turnitin.com. These submissions may be included as source
documents in reference databases for the purpose of detecting
plagiarism of such papers or codes.
