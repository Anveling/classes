Virtual Cluster with Kubernetes
=================================

You will be using cloudmesh and ansible to build a kubernetes swarm cluster on cloud resources.

This may include one or more clouds while using cloudmesh as a basis
for deployment. You will be developing a benchmark suite (you can
resue benchmarks developed by others) and conduct a sophisticated set
of benchmarks on such a cluster.

You will contrast these benchmarks with other virtual clusters set up
for example on openstack.  Integrating heterogeneous resources from
multiple clouds would also be useful and identifying the impact on the
benchmarks.

Develop carefully a plan for the benchmarks.

Instead of just running the becnhmark, on an existing infrastructure,
we expect that the benchmarks can be replicated with a script or
series of script to automatically gather the results in a table that
than gets automatically plotted.
