Using GitLab
======================================================================

This course requires the use of `GitLab.com <https://gitlab.com/>`_
for your homework submissions.

Once you have completed the entry survey you will be granted access to
a git repository in which to develop your homework submissions. What
you submit to canvas will be a link to a folder or file in your gitlab
repository.

The repository should consist of a subfolder in the root directory for
each assignment, e.g. ``prg1``, ``prg2``, ``project``, for programming
assignment 1, programming assignment 2 and your project.

.. important::

   The above are just examples. The assignment prompts will indicate
   the exact name for each subdirectory.  It is imperative that you
   adhere to the name that will be specified else you may have points
   deducted.



Requirements
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You will need to install git on your workstation. Once you have done
so, make sure to configure git to use your name and email address
label your commits.


::

   $ git config --global user.name "Albert Einstein"
   $ git config --global user.email albert@iu.edu


.. warning::

   Make sure to substitute in your name and email address in the
   commands above.


You should also configure the push behavior to push only matching
branches. See the `git documentation
<https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config>`_ for more details on what this
means.


::

   $ git config --global push.default matching
