Getting Access to systems
-----------------------------

Certain Homework will must be delivered on time. These are mostly
homework related to setting up your accounts and getting you access to
certain systems. We will make announcements when a homework needs to be
on time. If such a homework is not on time you may experience
significant delays in gaining access to the systems. Systems staff is
available only during regular buisiness hours Mo-Fri 10am - 4pm.
