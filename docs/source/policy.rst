Email 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

TBD

You can expect a reply from someone on the course staff within 24 hours; if you do not receive one, please re-send your email. If you are writing with questions about the assignments or course material, please ask on the Discussion Forums so that other students can benefit from the discussion. For sensitive personal matters, feel free to email the instructors directly (djcran@indiana.edu or sblancor@indiana.edu).

Tbd. Live Class Sessions
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Live class sessions will be held **TBD**. We will be using ZOOM for all live sessions. You can find the time and link to the sessions under "Class/ Office Hours" in the navigation bar. 

Ok. Office Hours
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Office hours will be held every week. These are live sessions that will allow you to interact one-on-one or in groups with either an instructor ow a TA. During these times, we can be reached via a ZOOM link, found under the "Class/Office Hours" tab. All office hour sessions may be recorded.

Course Overview
----------------------------------------------------------------------

TBD.

OK. Prerequisites
----------------------------------------------------------------------

In case you elect a programming project we will assume that you are familiar with the programming languages required as part of the project you suggest. We will limit the languages to Python, Java, and JavaScript.
If you do not know the required technologies, we will expect you to learn it outside of class. For example, Python has a reputation for being easy to learn, and those with strong programming background in another general-purpose programming language (like C/C++, Java, Ruby, etc.) can learn it within a few days. Please consult the instructor if you have concerns about your programming background. In addition, we may encounter math of various kinds, including linear 1 algebra, probability theory, and basic calculus. We students with limited math backgrounds may need to do additional reading outside of class.


Textbook

NONE

TBD. Grading
-------------

Assignments (50%), approximately 6, most of which will require substantial programming projects.
In-class assignments and quizzes (20%), not necessarily announced ahead of time. We will drop the lowest quiz score, but otherwise no make-up quizzes will be given except as specified below under Attendance Policy. The quizzes are not intended to be stressful events, but instead are designed to (a) help prepare students for the final exam, (b) encourage students to keep up with course material on a daily basis, (c) reward students who attend class regularly, and (d) give the instructors feedback on topics of confusion.
Final exam (30%), Thursday December 17, 7:15-9:15pm. 

TBD. Late Submission Policy
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Assignments will be accepted up to 48 hours after the due date, but a 10% late penalty will be assessed. Assignments received more than 48 hours late will not be accepted and will receive a grade of 0. Note: All assignments must be submitted according to the instructions given on the assignment hand-outs, which will typically require electronic (online) submission. We use the time that submissions are received by the servers to judge timeliness. It is the studentâ€™s responsibility to upload submissions well ahead of the deadline to avoid last minute problems with network connectivity, browser crashes, etc. It is a very good idea to make early submissions and then upload updates as the deadline approaches; we will grade the last submission received before the deadline. 

Academic Integrity Policy
----------------------------------------------------------------------

We take academic integrity very seriously. You are required to abide by the Indiana University policy on academic integrity, as described in the Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct, as well as the Computer Science Statement on Academic Integrity (http://www.soic.indiana. edu/doc/graduate/graduate-forms/Academic-Integrity-Guideline-FINAL-2015.pdf). It is your responsibility to understand these policies. Briefly summarized, the work you submit for course assignments, projects, quizzes, and exams must be your own or that of your group, if groupwork is permitted. You may use the ideas of others but you must give proper credit. You may discuss assignments with other students but you must acknowledge them in the refrence section according to scholarly citation rules. Please also make sure that you know how to not plagerise text from other sources while reviewing citation rules.

We will respond to acts of plagiarism and academic misconduct according to university policy. Sanctions typically involve a grade of 0 for the assignment in question and/or a grade of F in the course. In addition, University policy requires us to report the incident to the Dean of Students, who may apply additional sanctions, including expulsion from the university.

Students agree that by taking this course, papers and source code submitted to us may be subject to textual similarity review, for example by Turnitin.com. These submissions may be included as source documents in reference databases for the purpose of detecting plagiarism of such papers or codes.

Licensing
---------

All projects are developed under an open source license such as Apache 2.0 License, or similar. You will be required to add a License file and if you use other software identify how it can be reused in your project. Code repositories are for code, if you have additional libraries that are needed you need to develop a script or use a DeVOps framework to install such software. Thus zip files and .class, .o files are not permissable in the project. Ech project must be reproducable with a simple script. An example is

    git clone ....  
    make install
    make run
    make view

Which would use a simple make file to install, run, and view the results. Naturally you can use ansible or shell scripts. It is not permissible to use GUI based DevOps preinstalled frameworks. Everything must be installable form the command line.


Report Format
---------------

All reports will be using the ACM pubform format. The Word template can be found at TBD A LaTeX version can be found at https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template There will be **NO EXEPTION** to this format. In case you are in a team, you can use either github while collaboratively developing the LaTeX document or use MicrosoftOne Drive which allows collaborative editing features. All bibliographical entries must be put into a bibliography manager such as jabref, Mendeley, or endnote. This will gurantee that you follow proper citation styles. You can use either ACM or IEEE refernce styles. Documents that do not follow the ACM format and are not accomponied by refrences managed with jabref or endnote will be returned without review.
