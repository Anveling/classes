FAQ

The university says there are no prerequisites for the class, what are the prerequisites?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have communicated the prerequisites clearly to the
university. Apparently, they forgot to add them to the class.
The perquisites can be found in the appropriate class
overview. 

For I524 you find them at:

* https://cloudmesh.github.io/classes/i524/index.html#prerequisites

Why is this class not hosted on EdX?
------------------------------------

I523 and I524 were the first classes hosted on EdX. We wanted to
continue offering them on EdX. However, the
university system administrators mentioned to us that their systems are
not ready at this time to support this class in EdX. This is out of
our control and we hope that the university will soon update to an EdX
system that can host our classes.

Why are you not using CANVAS for communicating with students?
-------------------------------------------------------------

It has been proven that CANVAS communication is an inferior
communication system and can not compete with piazza's group
communication features. As we adopt state of the art technologies, we
like to expose you to state of the art communication tools such as
piazza instead of using technologies that have shown not to support
our communication pathways that we use in class.

Why are you using github for submitting projects and papers?
------------------------------------------------------------

This class is about open source technology and we like that you benefit
from material others in the class are developing or have developed. All
assignments are openly submitted to the class github for everyone to
see. As part of the goal of this class is to develop reusable
deployments. Such reuse is only possible if the code is publicly
available and others can benefit from it.

The technology papers are made accessible so you can read other
technology papers and can get an introduction in technologies that you
may not yet know about. It also allows others to contribute to your
technology papers and improve them.




I am full time student at IUPUI. Can I take the online version?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Yes you can.

If you are an international student, I suggest you verify this with
the office and the registrar. There may be some restrictions for
international students. Also some degree programs may have a limit or
do not allow to take online classes. It will be up to you to verify
the requirements with the appropriate administrators.

I am a residential student at IU. Can I take the online version only?
--------------------------------------------------------------

We recommend you take the residential class.

If you are an international student or a student of a particular
degree program restrictions may be placed in if and how many online
courses you can take. It will be up to you to contact the appropriate
administrative departments including the international student office
to verify what is allowed for you. In general international students
have such restrictions. Please find out what they are and which
section of the course is appropriate for you. 

The class is full what do I do?
-------------------------------

#. Make sure to put yourself on the waiting list.
#. If you are a residential student show up on the first class in the
   specified lecture room. More likely than not some students wil
   enroll in more classes than they can do and places will free up. We
   will create a list and discuss with the registrar what to do.
   
Do I need to buy a textbook?
----------------------------

No, the resources will be provided for every unit. However, we
recommend that you identify useful books for the class that can help
you. Examples include

#. “Taming The Big Data Tidal Wave: Finding Opportunities in Huge Data
   Streams with Advanced Analytics”, Bill Franks Wiley ISBN:
   978-1-118-20878-6
#. “Doing Data Science: Straight Talk from the Frontline”, Cathy O'Neil,
   Rachel Schutt, O'Reilly Media, ISBN 978-1449358655

If you find good books, wil like to add them here.
   
Do I need a computer to participate in this class?
--------------------------------------------------

Obviously if you are an online student you do need a computer. If you
are a residential student the facilities provided by SOIC will be
sufficient. However, as you study involves computers, its probably
important to evaluate if a computer will make your work easier. 

If it comes to what computer to buy we really do not have a good
recommendation as this depends on your budget. A computer running
Linux or OSX makes programming probably easier. A windows computer has
the advantage of also being able to run Word and ppt (so does OSX). A
cheap machine with multiple cores and sufficient memory (16GB+) is a
good idea. A SSD will make access to data especially if large data
snappy.

For this reason I myself use a Mac, but you probably can get much
cheaper machines with similar specs elsewhere.

Other students bought themselves a cheap computer and installed Linux
on it so they do not interfere with their work machines or with
Windows. Given how inexpensive computers these days are this may be a
reasonable idea. However, do not go too cheap have enough memory and
use an SSD if you can.

Which bibliography manager is required for the class?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

We require you use jabref:

#. `http://www.jabref.org/ <http://www.jabref.org/>`_


Can I use endnote or other bibliography managers?
-------------------------------------------------

Yes. if you want to make your life much more complicated. Jabref is
best for us and we do require that you hand in all bibliographies
while cleaning and transferring then to jabref. We will not accept any
other bibliography tool such as:

How many hours will this course take to work on every week?
-----------------------------------------------------------

This question can not rely be answered precisely. Typically we have
2-3 hours video per week. However starting from that its difficult to
put a real number down as things may also depend on your background.

* The programming load is modest, but requires knowledge in python
  which you may have to learn outside of this class.

* Some students have more experience than others, thus it may be
  possible to put in 6 hours per week overall, but other may have to
  put in 12 hours, while yet others may enjoy this class so much that
  they spend a lot more hours.

* We will certainly not stopping you form spending time in the class.
  It will be up to you to figure out how much time you will spend.

* Please remember that procrastination will not pay of in this class.
  
* The project or term paper will take a significant amount of time.
