  abstract     = {Nagios is a platform, which provides a set of software for network
infrastructure monitoring. It also offers administrative tools to
diagnose when failure events happen, and to notify operators when
hardware issues are detected. Specifically, :cite:`www-nagios`
illustrates that Nagios is consist of modules including: a core anqd
its dedicated tool for core configuration, extensible plugins and its
frontend. Nagios core is designed with scalability being well
considered. David Josephsen in :cite:`nagios-book` depicted Nagios "as
a specification language and foundation for building well designed
monitoring systems that can scale to serve any organization." Nagios
allows extensions to be plugged in and to collaborate with its core
through APIs. Plugins can be developed via static languages like C or
script languages. This mechanism empowers Nagios to monitor a large
set of various scenarios yet being very
flexible. :cite:`nagios-paper-2012` emphasises Nagios' "flexible
modular architecture, Nagios allows users to develop custom modules to
enhance the system functionality in many different ways." Besides its
open source components, Nagios also has commercial products to serve
needing clients.},

There is neither concept of data tables nor data types. Records are organized in hash table or B+ tree.
Kyoto Cabinet runs very fast. For example, elapsed time to store one million records is 0.9 seconds for hash database, and 1.1 seconds for B+ tree database. Moreover, the size of database is very small. For example, overhead for a record is 16 bytes for hash database, and 4 bytes for B+ tree database. Furthermore, scalability of Kyoto Cabinet is great. The database size can be up to 8EB (9.22e18 bytes)."},
