Just upload your code and Google will manage your app's availability. There are no servers for you to provision or maintain. }

  abstract     = {Nagios is a platform, which provides a set of software for network
infrastructure monitoring. It also offers administrative tools to
diagnose when failure events happen, and to notify operators when
hardware issues are detected. Specifically, :cite:`www-nagios`
illustrates that Nagios is consist of modules including: a core anqd
its dedicated tool for core configuration, extensible plugins and its
frontend. Nagios core is designed with scalability being well
considered. David Josephsen in :cite:`nagios-book` depicted Nagios "as
a specification language and foundation for building well designed
monitoring systems that can scale to serve any organization." Nagios
allows extensions to be plugged in and to collaborate with its core
through APIs. Plugins can be developed via static languages like C or
script languages. This mechanism empowers Nagios to monitor a large
set of various scenarios yet being very
flexible. :cite:`nagios-paper-2012` emphasises Nagios' "flexible
modular architecture, Nagios allows users to develop custom modules to
enhance the system functionality in many different ways." Besides its
open source components, Nagios also has commercial products to serve
needing clients.},
