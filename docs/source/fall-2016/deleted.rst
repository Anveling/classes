We have set up a ticketing system for this class with Google
Collaborative Groups e-mails at

* https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/big-data-iu-fall-2016-help

This mailinglist is for general help and to contact instructors and
TAs. This mailinglist is shared with all TAs, Dr. von Laszewski, and
Dr. Abdul-Wahid

You can expect a reply from someone on the course staff within 24
hours; if you do not receive one, please re-send your email.

We also have a general discussion mailing list at

* https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bigdata-iu-fall-2016

If you are writing with questions about the assignments or course
material, please ask on the Discussion Forums so that other students
can benefit from the discussion. For sensitive personal matters, feel
free to email the instructors directly (laszewski@gmail.com).

Class announcements are send to:

* https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/big-data-iu-fall-2016-announce

You will be responsible that you verify that you are subscribed to
this list. We will not use canvas e-mail system to communicate with
you and it may only be used initially.
