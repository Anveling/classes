Team work hints
---------------

Please chose a teame wisely. Team members that do not contribute to your
project are not beneficial for you as the deliverables for teams are
higher than for individuals. However, in many cases haveing a team is
beneficial as you can discuss problems within your team and leverage
each others expertise.

In the final project submission an additional page has to be submitted
detailing which team member did what.
