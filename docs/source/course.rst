Section 1 - Overview
======================================================================

This section has a technical overview of course followed by a broad
motivation for course.

The course overview covers it's content and structure. It presents the
X-Informatics fields (defined values of X) and the Rallying cry of
course: Use Clouds running Data Analytics Collaboratively processing
Big Data to solve problems in X-Informatics ( or e-X). The courses is
set up as a MOOC divided into units that vary in length but are
typically around an hour and those are further subdivided into 5-15
minute lessons.

The course covers a mix of applications (the X in X-Informatics) and
technologies needed to support the field electronically i.e. to
process the application data. The overview ends with a discussion of
course content at highest level. The course starts with a longish
Motivation unit summarizing clouds and data science, then units
describing applications (X = Physics, e-Commerce, Web Search and Text
mining, Health, Sensors and Remote Sensing). These are interspersed
with discussions of infrastructure (clouds) and data analytics
(algorithms like clustering and collaborative filtering used in
applications). The course uses either Python or Java and there are
Side MOOCs discussing Python and Java tracks.

The course motivation starts with striking examples of the data deluge
with examples from research, business and the consumer. The growing
number of jobs in data science is highlighted. He describes industry
trend in both clouds and big data. Then the cloud computing model
developed at amazing speed by industry is introduced. The 4 paradigms
of scientific research are described with growing importance of data
oriented version.He covers 3 major X-informatics areas: Physics,
e-Commerce and Web Search followed by a broad discussion of cloud
applications. Parallel computing in general and particular features of
MapReduce are described. He comments on a data science education and
the benefits of using MOOC's.

Jobs abound in clouds and data science. There are documented shortages
in data science, computer science and the major tech companies
advertise for new talent.

http://youtu.be/h9u7YeKkHHU
 

Lesson 4 - Industrial Trends
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 

Trends include the growing importance of mobile devices and
comparative decrease in desktop access, the export of internet
content, the change in dominant client operating systems, use of
social media, thriving chinese internet companies.

http://youtu.be/EIRIPDYN5nM

Lesson 5 - Digital Disruption of Old Favorites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Not everything goes up. The rise of the Internet has led to declines
in some traditional areas including Shopping malls and Postal
Services.

http://youtu.be/RxGopRuMWOE

 

Lesson 6 - Computing Model: Industry adopted clouds which are attractive for data analytics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clouds and Big Data are transformational on a 2-5 year time scale.
Already Amazon AWS is a lucrative business with almost a $4B revenue.
Geoffrey describes the nature of cloud centers with economies of scale
and gives examples of importance of virtualization in server
consolidation. Then key characteristics of clouds are reviewed with
expected high growth in Infrastructure, Platform and Software as a
Service.

http://youtu.be/NBZPQqXKbiw


 

Lesson 7 - Research Model: 4th Paradigm; From Theory to Data driven science?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
Geoffrey introduces the 4 paradigms of scientific research with the
focus on the new fourth data driven methodology.

http://youtu.be/2ke459BRBhw
 

Lesson 8 - Data Science Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 

Geoffrey introduces the DIKW data to information to knowledge to
wisdom paradigm. Data flows through cloud services transforming itself
and emerging as new information to input into other transformations.

http://youtu.be/j9ytOaBoe2k

Lesson 9 - Physics-Informatics Looking for Higgs Particle with Large Hadron Collider LHC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
Geoffrey looks at important particle physics example where the Large
hadron Collider has observed the Higgs Boson. He shows this discovery
as a bump in a histogram; something that so amazed him 50 years ago
that he got a PhD in this field. He left field partly due to the
incredible size of author lists on papers.

http://youtu.be/qUB0q4AOavY
 

Lesson 10 - Recommender Systems I
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many important applications involve matching users, web pages, jobs,
movies, books, events etc. These are all optimization problems with
recommender systems one important way of performing this optimization.
Geoffrey goes through the example of Netflix -- everything is a
recommendation and muses about the power of viewing all sorts of
things as items in a bag or more abstractly some space with funny
properties.

http://youtu.be/Aj5k0Sa7XGQ

 

Lesson 11 - Recommender Systems II
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
Many important applications involve matching users, web pages, jobs,
movies, books, events etc. These are all optimization problems with
recommender systems one important way of performing this optimization.
Geoffrey goes through the example of Netflix -- everything is a
recommendation and muses about the power of viewing all sorts of
things as items in a bag or more abstractly some space with funny
properties.

http://youtu.be/VHS7il5OdjM


 

Lesson 12 - Web Search and Information Retrieval
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 

This course also looks at Web Search and here Geoffrey gives an
overview of the data analytics for web search, Pagerank as a method of
ranking web pages returned and uses material from Yahoo on the subtle
algorithms for dynamic personalized choice of material for web pages.

http://youtu.be/i9gR9PdVXUU
 

Lesson 13 - Cloud Application in Research
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
Geoffrey describes scientific applications and how they map onto
clouds, supercomputers, grids and high throughput systems. He likes
the cloud use of the Internet of Things and gives examples.

http://youtu.be/C19-5WQH2TU
 

Lesson 14 - Parallel Computing and MapReduce
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
Geoffrey defines MapReduce and gives a homely example from fruit
blending.

http://youtu.be/BbW1PFNnKrE
 

Lesson 15 - Data Science Education
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
Geoffrey discusses one reason you are taking this course -- Data
Science as an educational initiative and aspects of its Indiana
University implementation. Then general; features of online education
are discussed with clear growth spearheaded by MOOC's where Geoffrey
uses this course and others as an example. He stresses the choice
between one class to 100,000 students or 2,000 classes to 50 students
and an online library of MOOC lessons. In olden days he suggested
''hermit's cage virtual university'' -- gurus in isolated caves
putting together exciting curricula outside the traditional university
model. Grading and mentoring models and important online tools are
discussed. Clouds have MOOC's describing them and MOOC's are stored in
clouds; a pleasing symmetry.

http://youtu.be/x2LuiX8DYLs


 

Lesson 16 - Conclusions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
The conclusions highlight clouds, data-intensive methodology,
employment, data science, MOOC's and never forget the Big Data
ecosystem in one sentence "Use Clouds running Data Analytics
Collaboratively processing Big Data to solve problems in X-Informatics
educated in data science"

Section 2 - Overview of Data Science: What is Big Data, Data Analytics and X-Informatics? 
===============================================================================================
 


 Section Overview 
-----------------------------------------------------------

The course introduction starts with X-Informatics and its rallying
cry. The growing number of jobs in data science is highlighted. The
first unit offers a look at the phenomenon described as the Data
Deluge starting with its broad features. Data science and the famous
DIKW (Data to Information to Knowledge to Wisdom) pipeline are
covered. Then more detail is given on the flood of data from Internet
and Industry applications with eBay and General Electric discussed in
most detail.

In the next unit, Geoffrey continues the discussion of the data deluge
with a focus on scientific research. He takes a first peek at data
from the Large Hadron Collider considered later as physics Informatics
and gives some biology examples. He discusses the implication of data
for the scientific method which is changing with the data-intensive
methodology joining observation, theory and simulation as basic
methods. Two broad classes of data are the long tail of sciences: many
users with individually modest data adding up to a lot; and a myriad
of Internet connected devices -- the Internet of Things.

Geoffrey gives an initial technical overview of cloud computing as
pioneered by companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft with new
centers holding up to a million servers. The benefits of Clouds in
terms of power consumption and the environment are also touched upon,
followed by a list of the most critical features of Cloud computing
with a comparison to supercomputing. Features of the data deluge are
discussed with a salutary example where more data did better than more
thought. Then comes Data science and one part of it -- data analytics
-- the large algorithms that crunch the big data to give big wisdom.
There are many ways to describe data science and several are discussed
to give a good composite picture of this emerging field.

 Unit 4 - Part II: Data Deluge and Scientific Applications and Methodology 
-----------------------------------------------------------
 

Unit Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 

Geoffrey continues the discussion of the data deluge with a focus on
scientific research. He takes a first peek at data from the Large
Hadron Collider considered later as physics Informatics and gives some
biology examples. He discusses the implication of data for the
scientific method which is changing with the data-intensive
methodology joining observation, theory and simulation as basic
methods. We discuss the long tail of sciences; many users with
individually modest data adding up to a lot. The last lesson
emphasizes how everyday devices -- the Internet of Things -- are being
used to create a wealth of data.

http://youtu.be/_JfcUg2cheg

 

Lesson 3 - Implications for Scientific Method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We discuss the emergences of a new fourth methodology for scientific
research based on data driven inquiry. We contrast this with third --
computation or simulation based discovery - methodology which emerged
itself some 25 years ago.

http://youtu.be/srEbOAmU_g8

 

Lesson 4 - Long Tail of Science
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
There is big science such as particle physics where a single
experiment has 3000 people collaborate!.Then there are individual
investigators who don't generate a lot of data each but together they
add up to Big data.

http://youtu.be/dwzEKEGYhqE
 

Lesson 5 - Internet of Things
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
A final category of Big data comes from the Internet of Things where
lots of small devices -- smart phones, web cams, video games collect
and disseminate data and are controlled and coordinated in the cloud.

 Section 3 - X= Health Informatics Case Study 
===================================================

 

 

Section Overview 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 

This section starts by discussing general aspects of Big Data and
Health including data sizes, different areas including genomics, EBI,
radiology and the Quantified Self movement. We review current state of
health care and trends associated with it including increased use of
Telemedicine. We summarize an industry survey by GE and Accenture and
an impressive exemplar Cloud-based medicine system from Potsdam. We
give some details of big data in medicine. Some remarks on Cloud
computing and Health focus on security and privacy issues.

We survey an April 2013 McKinsey report on the Big Data revolution in
US health care; a Microsoft report in this area and a European Union
report on how Big Data will allow patient centered care in the future.
Examples are given of the Internet of Things, which will have great
impact on health including wearables. A study looks at 4 scenarios for
healthcare in 2032. Two are positive, one middle of the road and one
negative. The final topic is Genomics, Proteomics and Information
Visualization.

Lesson 8 - McKinsey Report on the big-data revolution in US health care
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
This lesson covers 9 aspects of the McKinsey report. These are the
convergence of multiple positive changes has created a tipping point
for innovation; Primary data pools are at the heart of the big data
revolution in healthcare; Big data is changing the paradigm: these are
the value pathways; Applying early successes at scale could reduce US
healthcare costs by $300 billion to $450 billion; Most new big-data
applications target consumers and providers across pathways;
Innovations are weighted towards influencing individual
decision-making levers; Big data innovations use a range of public,
acquired, and proprietary data types; Organizations implementing a big
data transformation should provide the leadership required for the
associated cultural transformation; Companies must develop a range of
big data capabilities.

Lesson 12 - Extrapolating to 2032
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
A study looks at 4 scenarios for healthcare in 2032. Two are positive,
one middle of the road and one negative.

http://youtu.be/Qel4gmBxy8U
 

Lesson 13 - Genomics, Proteomics and Information Visualization I
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
A study of an Azure application with an Excel frontend and a cloud
BLAST backend starts this lesson. This is followed by a big data
analysis of personal genomics and an analysis of a typical DNA
sequencing analytics pipeline. The Protein Sequence Universe is
defined and used to motivate Multi dimensional Scaling MDS. Sammon's
method is defined and its use illustrated by a metagenomics example.
Subtleties in use of MDS include a monotonic mapping of the
dissimilarity function. The application to the COG Proteomics dataset
is discussed. We note that the MDS approach is related to the well
known chisq method and some aspects of nonlinear minimization of chisq
(Least Squares) are discussed.

http://youtu.be/r1yENstaAUE
 

Lesson 14 - Genomics, Proteomics and Information Visualization II
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This lesson continues the discussion of the COG Protein Universe
introduced in the last lesson. It is shown how Proteomics clusters are
clearly seen in the Universe browser. This motivates a side remark on
different clustering methods applied to metagenomics. Then we discuss
the Generative Topographic Map GTM method that can be used in
dimension reduction when original data is in a metric space and is in
this case faster than MDS as GTM computational complexity scales like
N not N squared as seen in MDS. 

Examples are given of GTM including an application to topic models in
Information Retrieval. Indiana University has developed a
deterministic annealing improvement of GTM. 3 separate clusterings are
projected for visualization and show very different structure
emphasizing the importance of visualizing results of data analytics.
The final slide shows an application of MDS to generate and visualize
phylogenetic trees.
