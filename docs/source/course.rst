Section 1 - Overview
======================================================================

This section has a technical overview of course followed by a broad
motivation for course.

The course overview covers it's content and structure. It presents the
X-Informatics fields (defined values of X) and the Rallying cry of
course: Use Clouds running Data Analytics Collaboratively processing
Big Data to solve problems in X-Informatics ( or e-X). The courses is
set up as a MOOC divided into units that vary in length but are
typically around an hour and those are further subdivided into 5-15
minute lessons.

The course covers a mix of applications (the X in X-Informatics) and
technologies needed to support the field electronically i.e. to
process the application data. The overview ends with a discussion of
course content at highest level. The course starts with a longish
Motivation unit summarizing clouds and data science, then units
describing applications (X = Physics, e-Commerce, Web Search and Text
mining, Health, Sensors and Remote Sensing). These are interspersed
with discussions of infrastructure (clouds) and data analytics
(algorithms like clustering and collaborative filtering used in
applications). The course uses either Python or Java and there are
Side MOOCs discussing Python and Java tracks.

The course motivation starts with striking examples of the data deluge
with examples from research, business and the consumer. The growing
number of jobs in data science is highlighted. He describes industry
trend in both clouds and big data. Then the cloud computing model
developed at amazing speed by industry is introduced. The 4 paradigms
of scientific research are described with growing importance of data
oriented version.He covers 3 major X-informatics areas: Physics,
e-Commerce and Web Search followed by a broad discussion of cloud
applications. Parallel computing in general and particular features of
MapReduce are described. He comments on a data science education and
the benefits of using MOOC's.

Lesson 2: Data Deluge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Geoffrey gives some amazing statistics for total storage; uploaded
video and uploaded photos; the social media interactions every minute;
aspects of the business big data tidal wave; monitors of aircraft
engines; the science research data sizes from particle physics to
astronomy and earth science; genes sequenced; and finally the long
tail of science. The next slide emphasizes applications using
algorithms on clouds. This leads to the rallying cry "Use Clouds
running Data Analytics Collaboratively processing Big Data to solve
problems in X-Informatics educated in data science'' with a catalog of
the many values of X ''Astronomy, Biology, Biomedicine, Business,
Chemistry, Climate, Crisis, Earth Science, Energy, Environment,
Finance, Health, Intelligence, Lifestyle, Marketing, Medicine,

Jobs abound in clouds and data science. There are documented shortages
in data science, computer science and the major tech companies
advertise for new talent.

http://youtu.be/h9u7YeKkHHU
 

Lesson 4 - Industrial Trends
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 

Trends include the growing importance of mobile devices and
comparative decrease in desktop access, the export of internet
content, the change in dominant client operating systems, use of
social media, thriving chinese internet companies.

Lesson 5 - Digital Disruption of Old Favorites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Not everything goes up. The rise of the Internet has led to declines
in some traditional areas including Shopping malls and Postal
Services.

http://youtu.be/RxGopRuMWOE

 

Lesson 6 - Computing Model: Industry adopted clouds which are attractive for data analytics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clouds and Big Data are transformational on a 2-5 year time scale.
Already Amazon AWS is a lucrative business with almost a $4B revenue.
Geoffrey describes the nature of cloud centers with economies of scale
and gives examples of importance of virtualization in server
consolidation. Then key characteristics of clouds are reviewed with
expected high growth in Infrastructure, Platform and Software as a
Service.

Lesson 7 - Research Model: 4th Paradigm; From Theory to Data driven science?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
Geoffrey introduces the 4 paradigms of scientific research with the
focus on the new fourth data driven methodology.

http://youtu.be/2ke459BRBhw
 

Lesson 8 - Data Science Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 

Geoffrey introduces the DIKW data to information to knowledge to
wisdom paradigm. Data flows through cloud services transforming itself
and emerging as new information to input into other transformations.

http://youtu.be/j9ytOaBoe2k

Lesson 9 - Physics-Informatics Looking for Higgs Particle with Large Hadron Collider LHC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
Geoffrey looks at important particle physics example where the Large
hadron Collider has observed the Higgs Boson. He shows this discovery
as a bump in a histogram; something that so amazed him 50 years ago
that he got a PhD in this field. He left field partly due to the
incredible size of author lists on papers.

http://youtu.be/qUB0q4AOavY
 

Lesson 10 - Recommender Systems I
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many important applications involve matching users, web pages, jobs,
movies, books, events etc. These are all optimization problems with
recommender systems one important way of performing this optimization.
Geoffrey goes through the example of Netflix -- everything is a
recommendation and muses about the power of viewing all sorts of
things as items in a bag or more abstractly some space with funny
properties.

Lesson 11 - Recommender Systems II
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
Many important applications involve matching users, web pages, jobs,
movies, books, events etc. These are all optimization problems with
recommender systems one important way of performing this optimization.
Geoffrey goes through the example of Netflix -- everything is a
recommendation and muses about the power of viewing all sorts of
things as items in a bag or more abstractly some space with funny
properties.

Lesson 12 - Web Search and Information Retrieval
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 

This course also looks at Web Search and here Geoffrey gives an
overview of the data analytics for web search, Pagerank as a method of
ranking web pages returned and uses material from Yahoo on the subtle
algorithms for dynamic personalized choice of material for web pages.

http://youtu.be/i9gR9PdVXUU
 

Lesson 13 - Cloud Application in Research
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
Geoffrey describes scientific applications and how they map onto
clouds, supercomputers, grids and high throughput systems. He likes
the cloud use of the Internet of Things and gives examples.

http://youtu.be/C19-5WQH2TU
 

Lesson 14 - Parallel Computing and MapReduce
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
Geoffrey defines MapReduce and gives a homely example from fruit
blending.

http://youtu.be/BbW1PFNnKrE
 

Lesson 15 - Data Science Education
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
Geoffrey discusses one reason you are taking this course -- Data
Science as an educational initiative and aspects of its Indiana
University implementation. Then general; features of online education
are discussed with clear growth spearheaded by MOOC's where Geoffrey
uses this course and others as an example. He stresses the choice
between one class to 100,000 students or 2,000 classes to 50 students
and an online library of MOOC lessons. In olden days he suggested
''hermit's cage virtual university'' -- gurus in isolated caves
putting together exciting curricula outside the traditional university
model. Grading and mentoring models and important online tools are
discussed. Clouds have MOOC's describing them and MOOC's are stored in
clouds; a pleasing symmetry.

Lesson 16 - Conclusions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
The conclusions highlight clouds, data-intensive methodology,
employment, data science, MOOC's and never forget the Big Data
ecosystem in one sentence "Use Clouds running Data Analytics
Collaboratively processing Big Data to solve problems in X-Informatics
educated in data science"
