Paper 1 Homework
=================================

In this homework you will write a short paper on one of the technologies that was assigned to you in the :ref:`TechList homework <techs-exercise>`. In the process, you will learn how to write a basic `LaTeX <https://www.latex-project.org/>`_ document. LaTeX is a document typestting environment used for writing scientific papers in many fields, and it is what we will use to write all papers in the class. Even if you are not planning to work in academia, LaTeX is a very powerful tool and can be useful for typesetting other types of documents, such as magazine articles, CVs, resumes, books and so on.

To complete the homework you will need to do the following.

1. Pick a technology you're interested in from the ones assigned to you. You can check your assignments in `this Piazza thread <https://piazza.com/class/ix39m27czn5uw?cid=31>`_ (and if you don't remember it, `find your HID in this thread <https://piazza.com/class/ix39m27czn5uw?cid=33>`_).

2. Decide on a LaTeX implementation you will use. Depending on the environment you want to work in (Windows, OSX, Linux, online) you will use a different LaTeX implementation. You can find more information about existing implementations here: https://www.latex-project.org/get/. There is more information about using a LaTeX implementation below.

3. Fork the homework repostiory at https://github.com/cloudmesh/sp17-i524. The forking process is exactly the same as the one described in the video for the Techlist homework and in the class website `README <https://github.com/cloudmesh/classes/blob/master/README.rst>`_: You will need to clone your fork, add the upstream remote, and make sure you keep your fork synchronized with the upstream. 

4. Follow the instructions in the homework repository's README file: https://github.com/cloudmesh/sp17-i524/blob/master/README.md: You will need to create a folder named after your HID in the `paper1` folder of the repository and copy the provided paper template there.

5. Write your paper committing changes as you write.

6. Push the final version of your paper to your fork.

7. Generate a pull request to merge your submission in the upstream like you did in the first assignment.

Choosing a LaTeX Implementation
----------------------------------
You will either want to choose a LaTeX implementation for your OS, or one available online. The advantage of installing a LaTeX environment on your system is that you will be able to use the `Makefile` provided with the paper template to easily compileyour LaTeX document. In an online LaTeX environment, you will need to copy the files from the template to it, and use whatever mechanism the environment provides for compiling.

A locally installed LaTeX environment also gives you more control to install packages. This is a more advanced usecase, but it is something to keep in mind, if you plan to use LaTeX beyond this class.

We can recommend and support TeXLive for Linux, MacTeX for OSX, MikTeX for Windows and ShareLaTeX online.

Paper Content
--------------
For the actual content of the paper, you need to write a two page overview of one of the technologies assigned to you in the TechList assignment. Your intended audience should be someone who might not have specific technical background in the area of the technology, but whose problem domain might benefit from it. Thus, the paper should provide context about the technology such as:

* What kind of problems has it been applied to successfully?
* What kind of infrastructure it needs?
* What are alternatives and how does the technology compare to them in terms of features, support, etc.

Submission
----------
Submission of this assignment will be in Github as outline above. Please, start early and raise any questions about the above process on Piazza and in the oinline office hours. Depending on how students are doing and what issues they are encountering, we will provide further resources to help you be successful in this assignment.
