Paper 1 Homework
=================================

In this homework you will write a short paper on one of the technologies that was assigned to you in the :ref:`TechList homework <techs-exercise>`. In the process, you will learn how to write a basic LaTeX document. LaTeX is a document typestting envrionment used for writing scientific papers in many fields, and it is what we will use to write all papers in the class. Even if you are not planning to work in academia, LaTeX is a very powerful tool and can be useful for typesetting other types of documents, such as magazine articles, CVs, resumes, books and so on.

To complete the homework you will need to do the following.

1. Pick a technology you're interested in from the ones assigned to you. You can check your assignments in this Piazza thread (and if you don't remember your HID, you can find it in this thread).

2. Decide on a LaTeX environment.

3. Fork the cloudmesh/sp17-i524 repository.

4. Pull your forked version of sp17-i524 and look at the README for instructions on how submissions will be done. Create HID folder under paper1, and copy the template there.

5. Write your paper committing changes as you write.

6. Push the final version of your paper to your fork.

7. Generate a pull request to merge your submission in the upstream.
