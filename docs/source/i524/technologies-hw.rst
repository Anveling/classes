FIXME ---

2. Go to https://cloudmesh.github.io/classes/ and click on “Fork me on GitHub” 
   to create a fork into your local repo
   
3. Go to your GitHub account and open the forked repository. 
	Click on “Clone or download” and “Open in Desktop” to download the file 
	directory on your local machine. Alternatively, you can find the files 
	in the browser, click on the pencil sign to “Edit this File”.
	You will update two files:
	- To add the paragraph about the technologies, go to classes/docs/source/i524/technologies.rst 
	- To add your references, go to  /docs/source/refs.bib
	
	IMPORTANT: Every reference is required to have:
	a)	owner field (for example: owner     = {TA-sp17-0001})
	b)	howpublished field for @misc cannot have URLs 
	(for example: howpublished = {Web Page})
	

	Before you commit your changes	remove advertisement adjectives and 
	sentences from your description, and spellcheck. 
	
4.	Do rebase or pull. 

5.  IMPORTANT: Write your commit summary with your "new:usr: ...." to 
	get credit for the assignment.
	
6.	Compile and commit if correct.  
  
7.	Finally, create a pull request (check if no new content conflict with yours)

2. Create a fork into your local repo

    Go to https://cloudmesh.github.io/classes/ and click on “Fork me on GitHub” 
    to create a fork into your local repo
   
3. Make sure you start your commit summary with your "new:usr: ...." only this
   way you get credit for he assignment. Make sure your references have
   an owner filed. make sure you do not put urls in howpublished for a MISC

   ... is a meaningful summary of what you did

   Every reference is required to have an owner field (for example: owner     = {TA-sp17-0001})

   In case your entry is MISC the howpublished field refers to the
   method on how it is published. A url is not allowed ( for example
   howpublished = {Web Page})
   
4. Make sure to remove advertisement adjectives and sentences

5. Make sure you spellcheck

6. Make sure you rebase or pull before you commit

7. Change the description in technology.rst

8. Add the reference in refs.bib  

9. compile

10. review compile

11. commit if correct

Tips
----

1. Why do I not see that my changes are published on the Web page?

   Changes will take time to be reviewed and integrated into the Web

   page. Changes will be done in two steps. First, they will be merged
   into the branch I524. Later, your changes will be merged into the
   master branch. You will see your changes in the master branch.

2. How do I know if I did it right?

   Check the https://github.com/cloudmesh/classes/pulls to see your 
   pull request.
   When your changes were approved and merged with the master branch, 
   your pull request will disappear.


Learning outcomes
-----------------

1. CANVAS is not a tool used in open source development and
   industry. It has limitations in scalability and in structuring
   effective communication with large numbers of
   students/collaborators.

   Instead we use industry accepted github for homework submission. To
   showcase one way of collaborating with more than 70 collaborators
   we will use the class Web page to demonstrate how this can be
   achieved with forks and pull requests. The TAs are responsible for
   communication to you how to do this and are also organizing the
   merge of your pull requests into the Master Web page.

2. As you look over the list you get familiar with technologies of
   interest.

3. You will learn how not to plagiarize

4. You will learn how to create proper references for Web-pages while
   using academic bibliography management tools.
