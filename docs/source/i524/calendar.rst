* (HD) hard deadlines must be done in order to obtain full
  points. These deadlines are important to assure you have access to
  the resources for the class.


Comments
--------

* Any late homework will have an automatic 10% grade deduction.
* Any late homework may result in substential delay in grading (one month or
  more).
* Hard deadlines can not receive any points for late submissions as they are
  essential to the communication and operation of the class. If you can naturally
  not communicate with we can not review your work or you can not even
  execute your work. 
* Experience shows that those using additional time during the spring break do
  typically better. We recommend that you use this time wisely.
* You can start earlier if you like to prepare for this class, to for example
  learn Python and ansible. However, lectures may change.
* It would be a mistke not to start working on your project by
  February 1st. You will run out of time. In order to accomodate for
  this we have segnificantly reduced other homework requirements in
  contrast to previous classes we taught.
