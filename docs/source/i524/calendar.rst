The official University calendar can be found here:

.. note:: Lectures have not yet been posted as part of this calendar,
	  Once we post them it is up to the student when they view
	  them.  We may introduce a system to verified that you viewed
	  and understood them, but we like to avoid this so you can
	  focus on the Papers and Project.

Proposed Grade Forumla (may be changed and adapted):




Comments:

* Any late homework will have an automatic 10% grade deduction.
* Any late homework may result in substential delay in grading (one month or
  more).
* Hard due dates can not receive any points for late submissions as they are
  essential to the communication and operation of the class. If you can naturally
  not communicate with us you cannot do your work. 
* Experience shows that those using additional time of the spring break to
  typically better. We recommend that you use this time wisely.
* You can start earlier if you like to prepare for this class, to for example
  learn Python and ansible
* It would be a mistke not to start working on your project by February 1st. You
  will run out of time. In order to accomodate for this we have reduced other
  homework requirements.
