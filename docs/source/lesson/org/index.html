Oragnization of the Web Page
============================

Any course we teach in the department needs some basic knowledge about
linux, programming, cloud computing, and documentation creation. We
have taken the lessons from a number of courses and made them
available as general available lessons. This enables ou to leverage
information you have been previously thought while expanding upon it
or refreshing it. If you have not been exposed to these lessosn or the
material befor you are welcome to use them to make sure you learn the
tools we use in the class.

Lessons may have homework attached with them. Please note that the
homework are unrelated to the course that you may take and that they
may not be assigned as part of this course. To make sure to see what
is needed, please visit the overview page, that lists all homework for
the appropriate course. It is just like if you were to take a regular
class that has a text book. The teacher may elect to skip a chapter,
or decide to assign just a subset of assignments. Assignments that are
not listed in the overview are not graded.
