Cloud (under construction)
==========================

A number of useful clouds exist that may be useful for this
class. However, if you do work on another cloud we require you to
replicate your setup on either

* Chameleoncloud (using cloudmesh and openstack)
* Jetstream (using cloudmesh and openstack not the GUI interface)
* Futuresystems (using cloudmesh and openstack) 
  
Useful cloudes include:

* Chameleoncloud.org :ref:`Chameleon <ref-chameleon>`
* futuresystems.org :ref:`QuickStart <ref-quickstart_openstack>`
* Amazon EC2 https://aws.amazon.com/
* Microsoft Azure Virtual Machine https://azure.microsoft.com
