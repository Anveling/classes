        are allowed. Software such as R or D3.js are accepted in the
        final project.

Python:

        Please read up on **virtualenv** and use that instead of youst
	overwriting the python environment from your computer. Please
	use an IDE if you like such as PyCharm. However you can also
	use editors such as emacs and vi/vim which are available for
	all operating systems. When using python we assume you use
	pip. Please read up on it.
	     
	* Install Python on your computer, use virtualenv
	* Learn Python
	* Learn Python pandas and do a simple Python application demonstrating:

		* a linechart
		* a barchart, e.g. a histogram

	Review of Scipy:

		* look at the scipy manual and be aware what you can do with
		  it in case you chose a Project

	Submit your programs in gitlab in a folder called *prg1*. THe
	programs are called linechart.py, histogram.py
	
Futuresystems:
	* Obtain an account on Futuresystems.org and join project
	  FG511. Not that this will take time and you need to do this
	  ASAP. No late assignments will be accepted. If you are late
	  this assignment will receive 0 points.
	  Fill out the Poll **TBD**. 
	
ChameleonCloud:
	* Obtain an account on https://www.chameleoncloud.org. Fill
	  out the Poll TBD (This assignment is optional, but we have
	  made good experience with Chameleon cloud, so we advise you
	  to get an account. As you are a student you will not be able
	  to create a project. We will announce the project in due
	  time that you can join and use chameleon cloud). 

OpenStack:
	* Inform yourself about OpenStack and how to start and stop
	  virtual machines via the command line.
	* Optionally, you can use cloudmesh_client for this (If you
          use cloudmesh client you will get bonus points).

Assignment Guidelines
======================================================================

Getting Access and Systems Support
----------------------------------------------------------------------

For some projects you will need access to a cloud. We recommend you
evaluate which cloud would be most appropriate for your project. This
includes:

* chameleoncloud.org
* furturesystems.org
* AWS (you will be responsible for charges)
* Azure (you will be responsible for charges)
* virtualbox if you have a powerful computer and like to prototype
* other clouds

We intend to make some small number of virtual machines available for
us in a project FG511 on FutureSystems:

* https://portal.futuresystems.org/projects/511

.. note:: FutureSystems OpenStack cloud is currently updated and will
	  not be available till Sept.
	  
Documentation about FutureSystems can be found at
:ref:`OpenStackFutureSystems <ref-quickstart_openstack>`
  
Once you created an account on FutureSystems and you do a project yOu
can add yourself to the project so you gain access. Systems staff is
available only during regular business hours Mo-Fri 10am - 4pm.  

You could also use the cloudmesh client software on Linux and OSX to
access multiple clouds in easy fashion. A Section will introduce this
software.


.. _s_paper_format:

Report and Paper Format
----------------------------------------------------------------------


All reports and paper assignments will be using the ACM proceedings
format. The MSWord template can be found here:

* :download:`paper-report.docx <files/paper-report.docx>`

A LaTeX version can be found at

* https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template
  
however you have to remove the ACM copyright notice in the LaTeX version.

There will be **NO EXEPTION** to this format. In case you are in a
team, you can use either gitlab while collaboratively developing the
LaTeX document or use MicrosoftOne Drive which allows collaborative
editing features. All bibliographical entries must be put into a
bibliography manager such as jabref, endnote, or Mendeley. This will
guarantee that you follow proper citation styles. You can use either
ACM or IEEE reference styles. Your final submission will include the
bibliography file as a separate document.

Documents that do not follow the ACM format and are not accompanied by
references managed with jabref or endnote or are not spell checked
will be returned without review.

Please do not use figures ore tables toe artificially inflate the
length of the report. Make figures readable and provide the original
images. Use PDF for figures and not png, gif, org jpeg. This way the
figures you produce are scalable and zooming into the paper will be
possible.

Report Checklist:

* [ ] Have you written the report in word or LaTeX in the specified
  format.
* [ ] In case of LaTeX, have you removed the ACM copyright information
* [ ] Have you included the report in gitlab.
* [ ] Have you specified the names and e-mails of all team members in
  your report. E.g. the username in Canvas.
* [ ] Have you included all images in native and PDF format in gitlab
  in the images folder.
* [ ] Have you added the bibliography file (such as endnote or bibtex
  file e.g. jabref) in a directory bib.
* [ ] Have you submitted an additional page that describes who did
  what in the project or report.
* [ ] Have you spellchecked the paper.
* [ ] Have you made sure you do not plageurize.


Software Project
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Develop a software system with OpenStack available on FutureSystems or
Chameleoncloud to support it. Only choose the software option if you
are prepared to take on programming tasks.
	     
In case of a software project, we encourage a group project with up to
three members.  You can use the discussion list for the
`Software Project <http://openedx.scholargrid.org/courses/SoIC/INFO-I-523/Fall_2016/courseware/7870c4bd238147e7a98e6a46f349f0cf/3d53c765145a457cbd003e80897723d4/>`_
to form project teams or just communicate privately with other class
members to formulate a team. The following artifacts are part of the
deliverables for a project

Code:
    You must deliver the code in gitlab. The code must be compilable
    and a TA may try to replicate to run your code. You MUST avoid
    lengthy install descriptions and everything must be installable
    from the commandline.

Project Report:
    A report must be produced while using the format discussed in the
    Report Format section. The following length is required:
							    
    * 3 pages, one student in the project		    
    * 5 pages, one student in the project		    
    * 7 pages, one student in the project		    
							    
    Reports can be longer up to 10 pages if needed.  Your high quality
    scientific report should describe a) What you did b) results
    obtained and c) Software documentation including how to install,
    and run it. If c) is longer than half a page and can not be
    reproduced with shell scripts or easy to folow steps you will get
    points deducted. 
    							    
Work Breackdown:
    This document is only needed for team projects. A one page PDF
    document describing who did what. It includes pointers to
    the git history that documents the statistics that demonstrate not
    only one student has worked on the project.

License:
    All projects are developed under an open source license such as
    Apache 2.0 License, or similar. You will be required to add a
    LICENCE.txt file and if you use other software identify how it can be
    reused in your project. If your project uses different licenses,
    please add in a README.rst file which packages are used and which
    license these packages have.

Code Repository:
    Code repositories are for code, if you have additional libraries
    that are needed you need to develop a script or use a DevOps
    framework to install such software. Thus zip files and .class, .o
    files are not permissible in the project. Each project must be
    reproducible with a simple script. An example is::

      git clone ....
      make install
      make run
      make view

    Which would use a simple make file to install, run, and view the
    results. Naturally you can use ansible or shell scripts. It is not
    permissible to use GUI based DevOps preinstalled
    frameworks. Everything must be installable form the command line.

Datasets that may inspire projects:
  * https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data/github
  * https://www.quora.com/Where-can-I-find-large-datasets-open-to-the-public
