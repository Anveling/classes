README
========

This repository contains class material. The class is published and updated oon regular basis at:

* https://cloudmesh.github.io/classes/

We are in the process of reorgannizing this directory and all cals material will be in docs/sources.

Previous content is in directories

- `spring-2017`_: Big Data Open Source Software Projects, `Spring 2017, RTD`_
- `fall-2016`_: Big Data Applications and Analytics, `Fall 2016, RTD`_
- `spring-2016`_: Big Data Open Source Software Projects, Spring 2016

These classes will be revisited over time and the content will be merged into the lessons directory.

Known External Repositores
============================

Several of the courses have been developed in separate
repositories. If a class is updated externally, the new history will
need to be merged by rerunning the ``git subtree add`` command above.

- `fall-2016`_: ``git@gitlab.com:cloudmesh/fall2016.git``
- `spring-2016`_: ``git@github.com:cglmoocs/bdossspring2016.git``
